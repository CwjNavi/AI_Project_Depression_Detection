I just met someone that I actually fallen in love with. She has anxiety disorder, I think she's been through a hard time becuase of her scars and amount of \"close calls\" overdosing the pills. After me being this stupid guy before, I once tried to help someone with the same thing. As you can guess this 1st person is still alive becuase of me but she wasn't herself anymore. Now when the next opportunity  comes, I just feel like It already happend and I don't want to engage becuase it will end the same way. I just feel worse and worse without talking to her but I also feel like nobody, like someone you couldn't like or even shouldn't like. I don't know how to live with that feeling, I know that I'm a fucking good person to the top, but I also know not everyone is like me and sometimes they will not know the effort put to just being close to someone, to save her life. I'm scared, this time not from OCD and depression, this time becuase of my own memories coming back, this time becuase of love I just can't stand as such emotional person. What should I really do? Help me seek some reasonable answers. I'm not typing this to make myself the worst person on the earth, I just write to get some help organizing my thoughts and my brain. Please help.</td>\n",

I look around and see nothing but bad memories, and empty promises. I begin to imagine myself with a needle in my hand. To once again feel the warm embrace of heroin, and if lucky. Maybe even death. My reminiscing is cut short by a 5 year old girl bursting into my room with a smile on her face. Felicity. My baby sister is one of the few reasons I get up in the morning. And to see the familiar, and chubby face brought me nothing but what I guess was joy. It is now time for me to put on the mask. \\n\\n\\nI’ve learned many things about depression in the past 3 years. One of those things is to never grant anybody access to my emotions. The trauma, and pain I have experienced from the hospitals I’ve been subjected to, are second to none. Absolute agony. So I wear a metaphorical mask, one of energy, and joy.  I walk down the carpet stairs whilst holding Felicity’s hand, and I am instantly greeted with the expectations for the day. Today I must play with Felicity, clean my room, do my laundry, clean my bathroom, clean the kitchen, and keep myself from killing myself, or getting high. I also cannot talk to either of my parents about how I’m doing, because I’d be bothering them. \\n\\nI don’t do most of these things. I simply take my medicine, and watch my humanity, and emotions slip away with a gulp. I do this everyday. I fall asleep as the medicine kicks in, and takes my energy. I do this everyday. I eat. And eat, and eat, and eat, until I feel like throwing up. I do nothing with my life. The only thing I do is listen to music. I love music. I truly adore all kinds of it. I love learning about music. I love listening to music. I play 4 instruments, and produce music. But I don’t anymore \\n\\nDepression has taken away my future. I don’t have the drive to create music. So I just sit. I sit. I eat, I sleep, and I do it all again. I’m so alone, I’m so sad. I’m so empty.\\n\\n\\nNot quite sure what this post is, but I feel like shit, and don’t want to live like this anymore.

I'm just venting about stuff so if it's boring or anything you don't have to read it, that's fine.\\n\\nI've been on antidepressants for a while now, almost approaching the 6 month mark. I've been suffering from depression and anxiety most of my life, and only sought out medical help and counselling recently after a period of consideration.\\n\\nBut they don't work. The medication just doesn't work. Counselling didn't work either. I have a private social media that I vent on which helps with my anxiety and occasional angry outbursts, but even they are starting to feel less helpful. I just feel dead. My family don't feel like my family, I have no emotion towards them whatsoever, and I spent the holidays quietly keeping out of everyone's way. \\n\\nSelf harming is a thing which I've been doing since I was around 15-16. I have gotten over it from time to time, but the last 3 months have been hell for it.\\n\\nI'm losing interest in everything I used to love. Gaming was a big escape for me, especially fantasy, and now Gaming is almost a distant memory for me. I lose interest almost straight after I start a game up, and I just end up laying on my bed instead, either sleeping the day away or just staring into space. It's not fun. \\n\\nI'm a university student so I was expecting a lack of free time to do stuff like gaming so that's understandable, but I've had loads of free time. I've been pushing myself to be a more hardworking student, and it's paid off in some respect, since it frees up my weekends usually. But still I don't want to do anything. \\n\\nI say hardworking, but finding the motivation to do my work is something that comes once in a blue moon. I've spent countless all nighters at my university trying to get work done in tiny amounts. My attendance is fine but I get the impression I'm being judged for my actions.\\n\\nThe other issue I've noticed is that I've stopped eating properly. I'm capable of cooking the basics, trust me. But I have no appetite. I've become noticeably thinner and when people comment on it or worry about how skinny I am I just shrug it off. I don't like the thought of my friends and peers noticing how bad I'm getting. \\n\\nI think I've ranted enough here, I apologize for the massive wall of text, thanks for reading this though.</td>\n",

I give up. \\n\\nHappy f&amp;amp;\\*king 2020....I hope it's my last and I finally just suck it up and pull the noose tight enough this time, or push the blade deep enough.....but I'm also thinking Carbon Monoxide - my car already stinks of fumes, &amp;amp; I was told didn't 'need' catalytic converter ie. would help fix problem 'easier' too remove....got thinking.....'yes, take it off'. ;) That will be my request next time I can afford to take car in.  I'm already cleaning my car in prep.  Don't want to be 'found' in a messy car.  :)</td>\n",

       "      <td>I'm really struggling : So I don't know how to start things like this, So I'll start with basics. I'm 16yo, diagnosed depression at 14yo. Since then, my life is total mess. I've already been to two different psychologists, both of them said that i'm kind of unfixable, but that might be due to my young age. Why People that are supposed to help me, say things like that?! Since start of 2019, my life got even worse. My family, on outside, caring and loving, but inside, unthoughtful. All of my friends are fake, all of them try to take adventage of my current problems. I had a gf, she was really cute and loving, but she started ignoring me since christmas, today she broke up with me. My classmates don't care about me, and some of them wish me death. You might think, \"well, it isn't that bad, deal with it kid\", but thats really hard for me. My parents think that it's all fake, also they said that i Just do it, because i want some attencion. After my 1st suicide attempt, they said that I've gone too far with my \"Attention whore\" attitude. I've already had 6 suicide attempts, all of them ended up with getting yelled at by family and friends. Nobody really cared that i would Be gone, they were more afraid of going to court to give some reasons why i would do that, than me being dead. Also they said that it would bring them bad reputation. I'm feeling worthless, useless and i think that World would Be much better place without me... Now I'm Just a crying mess without any support and without any will to live.\\nIf you survived this story, thank you. I Just need to write about it, maybe it Will help me a bit.\\n(Sorry for my bad English, I'm still learning)</td>\n",

Another nightmare times. : Hi, I've got depression and OCD, I'm being treated with sertraline (200mg) for about 0.5 year. I just met someone that I actually fallen in love with. She has anxiety disorder, I think she's been through a hard time becuase of her scars and amount of \"close calls\" overdosing the pills. After me being this stupid guy before, I once tried to help someone with the same thing. As you can guess this 1st person is still alive becuase of me but she wasn't herself anymore. Now when the next opportunity  comes, I just feel like It already happend and I don't want to engage becuase it will end the same way. I just feel worse and worse without talking to her but I also feel like nobody, like someone you couldn't like or even shouldn't like. I don't know how to live with that feeling, I know that I'm a fucking good person to the top, but I also know not everyone is like me and sometimes they will not know the effort put to just being close to someone, to save her life. I'm scared, this time not from OCD and depression, this time becuase of my own memories coming back, this time becuase of love I just can't stand as such emotional person. What should I really do? Help me seek some reasonable answers. I'm not typing this to make myself the worst person on the earth, I just write to get some help organizing my thoughts and my brain. Please help.   \n",

I ponder if I want to get out of my bed, let alone my room. I look around and see nothing but bad memories, and empty promises. I begin to imagine myself with a needle in my hand. To once again feel the warm embrace of heroin, and if lucky. Maybe even death. My reminiscing is cut short by a 5 year old girl bursting into my room with a smile on her face. Felicity. My baby sister is one of the few reasons I get up in the morning. And to see the familiar, and chubby face brought me nothing but what I guess was joy. It is now time for me to put on the mask. \\n\\n\\nI’ve learned many things about depression in the past 3 years. One of those things is to never grant anybody access to my emotions. The trauma, and pain I have experienced from the hospitals I’ve been subjected to, are second to none. Absolute agony. So I wear a metaphorical mask, one of energy, and joy.  I walk down the carpet stairs whilst holding Felicity’s hand, and I am instantly greeted with the expectations for the day. Today I must play with Felicity, clean my room, do my laundry, clean my bathroom, clean the kitchen, and keep myself from killing myself, or getting high. I also cannot talk to either of my parents about how I’m doing, because I’d be bothering them. \\n\\nI don’t do most of these things. I simply take my medicine, and watch my humanity, and emotions slip away with a gulp. I do this everyday. I fall asleep as the medicine kicks in, and takes my energy. I do this everyday. I eat. And eat, and eat, and eat, until I feel like throwing up. I do nothing with my life. The only thing I do is listen to music. I love music. I truly adore all kinds of it. I love learning about music. I love listening to music. I play 4 instruments, and produce music. But I don’t anymore \\n\\nDepression has taken away my future. I don’t have the drive to create music. So I just sit. I sit. I eat, I sleep, and I do it all again. I’m so alone, I’m so sad. I’m so empty.\\n\\n\\nNot quite sure what this post is, but I feel like shit, and don’t want to live like this anymore. Any advice is appreciated   \n",

My parents are often annoying and rude with me, but when they see news on the tv where young people died they often say that they wouldn't bear if I died and that they would kill themself.\\n\\nAnd because of this I can't kill myself. I would feel too guilty. I've now been in a depression for a long time and it's getting worst and worst really fast. It's actually come to a point where I'm hoping that my parents will die/kill themself/tell me that they don't care about me, or anything that could let me kill myself in peace. I'm spoiling on the inside because my will of dying is growing fast, and I feel like I can't do anything.\\n\\n\\nI'm fucking hopeless   \n",
       "3402  Feeling numb. : Okay this is my first post, apologies if it's long or anything. I'm just venting about stuff so if it's boring or anything you don't have to read it, that's fine.\\n\\nI've been on antidepressants for a while now, almost approaching the 6 month mark. I've been suffering from depression and anxiety most of my life, and only sought out medical help and counselling recently after a period of consideration.\\n\\nBut they don't work. The medication just doesn't work. Counselling didn't work either. I have a private social media that I vent on which helps with my anxiety and occasional angry outbursts, but even they are starting to feel less helpful. I just feel dead. My family don't feel like my family, I have no emotion towards them whatsoever, and I spent the holidays quietly keeping out of everyone's way. \\n\\nSelf harming is a thing which I've been doing since I was around 15-16. I have gotten over it from time to time, but the last 3 months have been hell for it.\\n\\nI'm losing interest in everything I used to love. Gaming was a big escape for me, especially fantasy, and now Gaming is almost a distant memory for me. I lose interest almost straight after I start a game up, and I just end up laying on my bed instead, either sleeping the day away or just staring into space. It's not fun. \\n\\nI'm a university student so I was expecting a lack of free time to do stuff like gaming so that's understandable, but I've had loads of free time. I've been pushing myself to be a more hardworking student, and it's paid off in some respect, since it frees up my weekends usually. But still I don't want to do anything. \\n\\nI say hardworking, but finding the motivation to do my work is something that comes once in a blue moon. I've spent countless all nighters at my university trying to get work done in tiny amounts. My attendance is fine but I get the impression I'm being judged for my actions.\\n\\nThe other issue I've noticed is that I've stopped eating properly. I'm capable of cooking the basics, trust me. But I have no appetite. I've become noticeably thinner and when people comment on it or worry about how skinny I am I just shrug it off. I don't like the thought of my friends and peers noticing how bad I'm getting. \\n\\nI think I've ranted enough here, I apologize for the massive wall of text, thanks for reading this though.   \n",

I'm only 22 but I seriously don't see the point in living anymore. My dad died in 2018 and ever since then I've been worse. I lost my job, I don't have any friends, me and my partner always argue and we're going through crap now, my mums an alcoholic. I cannot do this anymore   \n",

My destiny?  I feel cursed. I was never Christened.  BUT this is the year I END the struggle and tears.  I'm done waiting for 'brighter days' or a 'stroke of good luck'.  Never happens.....I just lose more and more as the years go by.  I've now lost my family.  \\n\\nNot that I ever had them - I got moved to Canada from UK at 3.5....and moved 35 times since.  Watching the world move ahead of me financially....I'm just a spectator - despite working as hard, if not HARDER than most to 'better my life'. I give up. \\n\\nHappy f&amp;\\*king 2020....I hope it's my last and I finally just suck it up and pull the noose tight enough this time, or push the blade deep enough.....but I'm also thinking Carbon Monoxide - my car already stinks of fumes, &amp; I was told didn't 'need' catalytic converter ie. would help fix problem 'easier' too remove....got thinking.....'yes, take it off'. ;) That will be my request next time I can afford to take car in.

'Oh, you're so smart (sure - went to uni - fat lot of good it did me - I'm basically unemployed because of bi-polar and have huge debt), talented (oh yeah?  so why does no one buy my sh\\*t?!), pretty (okay - so, why in a joke relationship, no kids, no house then?)'.  \\n\\nWhy am I such a poor loser?? My destiny?  I feel cursed. I was never Christened.  BUT this is the year I END the struggle and tears.  I'm done waiting for 'brighter days' or a 'stroke of good luck'.  Never happens.....I just lose more and more as the years go by.  I've now lost my family.  \\n\\nNot that I ever had them - I got moved to Canada from UK at 3.5....and moved 35 times since.  Watching the world move ahead of me financially....I'm just a spectator - despite working as hard, if not HARDER than most to 'better my life'. I give up. \\n\\nHappy f&amp;\\*king 2020....I hope it's my last and I finally just suck it up and pull the noose tight enough this time, or push the blade deep enough.....but I'm also thinking Carbon Monoxide - my car already stinks of fumes, &amp; I was told didn't 'need' catalytic converter ie. would help fix problem 'easier' too remove....got thinking.....'yes, take it off'. ;) That will be my request next time I can afford to take car in.  I'm already cleaning my car in prep.  Don't want to be 'found' in a messy car.  :)   \n",

I'm 16yo, diagnosed depression at 14yo. Since then, my life is total mess. I've already been to two different psychologists, both of them said that i'm kind of unfixable, but that might be due to my young age. Why People that are supposed to help me, say things like that?! Since start of 2019, my life got even worse. My family, on outside, caring and loving, but inside, unthoughtful. All of my friends are fake, all of them try to take adventage of my current problems. I had a gf, she was really cute and loving, but she started ignoring me since christmas, today she broke up with me. My classmates don't care about me, and some of them wish me death. You might think, \"well, it isn't that bad, deal with it kid\", but thats really hard for me. My parents think that it's all fake, also they said that i Just do it, because i want some attencion. After my 1st suicide attempt, they said that I've gone too far with my \"Attention whore\" attitude. I've already had 6 suicide attempts, all of them ended up with getting yelled at by family and friends. Nobody really cared that i would Be gone, they were more afraid of going to court to give some reasons why i would do that, than me being dead. Also they said that it would bring them bad reputation. I'm feeling worthless, useless and i think that World would Be much better place without me... Now I'm Just a crying mess without any support and without any will to live.\\nIf you survived this story, thank you. I Just need to write about it, maybe it Will help me a bit.\\n(Sorry for my bad English, I'm still learning)   \n",

I’m a M18 and she’s a F16 and we are about 2 months into our official relationship after talking for about 2 months beforehand. She has told me about having insecurities about her body and how she wishes for a better ______(body part like legs or waist). She has told me about how she’s had issues of comparison and feelings of inferiority with numerous other girls about body image and social standing and other things. She has told me she hates herself numerous times and she jokes about wanting to kill herself (which almost everyone does though idk i just thought I should ad even though thats a different topic entirely). She also tends to have severe anxiety (or something) attacks where her chest starts to hurt and he breathing starts getting really fast. In an effort to be there for her I’ve tried to do the following things (these are the main things i keep in mind when addressing these topics with her in conversation or in action alike):\\n\\n- make it known that I am always here to talk to her at about anything at all, and that i will do anything and everything to support her when she’s feeling down.\\n- actually be there for her lol, giving her lots of hugs and other forms of affection. Being literally a shoulder to lean on if she needs it.\\n- make sure that when we talk about it I focus on her and why she feels the way she feels and just like trying to understand her feelings (and in the process of doing so allowing her to reflect on her feelings to i guess). Also making sure to try to not tell her how it makes me feel because its really not about me and guilt could cause her to maybe shut me out or something\\n-making sure i dont treat her any differently than if she didn’t have these thoughts so no random (“how are you feeling” etc...)\\n- and I’ve told no one aside from this anonymous reddit post which is also actually my first ever!\\n\\nNow I’d be lying if i said I haven’t messed up with doing/keeping those things (in mind). I have talked too much in conversations about this and i have said things in ways that were insensitive to her which she has thankfully been able to forgive. I’ve kind of just been approaching this by feel and just what feels right given the circumstances presented before me. Also, this is my first time experiencing being around someone this close who has these kinds of thoughts and feelings and further it’s just a really sensitive topic as we all know. \\n\\nI was just looking for tips or inspiration or just anything that you guys think would help me in this. Any pointers on what I could say or do when she tells me about feeling about self harm or when shes down? Is there something im not doing that I should be doing? Is there something im doing that I shouldn’t be doing? I love her a lot and I really want her to be happy and not be sad or have any of these thoughts/feelings but at the same time i dont think its anybody’s job nor is it in anyones ability to change someone else but i just want to be able to do everything i can to be there for her in this.\\n\\nThanks to anyone who responds!

I've had a lot of great periods in my life where I achieved things I'm still proud of to this day, but none of which had anything to do with a new year's resolution.

So learn how to enjoy your company. The most important thing is to love yourself, because you've been there for yourself all along and you deserve your love.

My girlfriend is NOT clinically depressed, but she is struggling. I am posting here because I feel this community may be able to help and some of you may have had similar experiences. \\n\\nMy girlfriend lost her sister several months ago. It was a senseless, shocking death. \\n\\nHere is the problem: her grieving is through her faith. She believes (or tries to believe) her sister is in Heaven.\\n\\nI am agnostic. I do not struggle with my views, and i do not believe in Heaven. I cannot in good conscience reinforce my gf’s beliefs that her sister is in Heaven, because I sincerely don’t believe that.\\n\\nI always listen to her. I hug and kiss her. I let her cry in my shoulder. She calls me at work just to hear my voice and I always answer. I wrap myself around her in bed so she has warmth to sleep next to. I encourage her to be the best she can be, because that is what her sis would want. I do my best to make her giggle and laugh, when appropriate. Her emotions are a rollercoaster.\\n\\nI am doing my best but i am not able to reinforce her faith and further her relationship with God. She has told me this, and we have discussed our religious differences a lot.\\n\\nWhat else can i do? I haven’t experienced similar loss. My parents both have lost siblings and i was thinking i could get them closer to her? My folks believe in God, but not heaven (Sikhism).\\n\\nI am aware religious differences usually end relationships, but that is not the purpose of this post. \\n\\n————\\n\\ntl;dr my religious gf believes her sister is in Heaven and i cannot share that belief. She otherwise loves me a lot and relies on me emotionally. Am I hindering her grieving? How can I help her? She wants me in her life, by the way. \\n\\nThank you all.

It could be anything that makes workthile the suffering life brings.\\n\\nSpeaking of worth , self esteem\\'s biggest component is social conparison,usually this manifests unconsciously in behaviour, your happiness will always be relative to others\\'- achievements and lives-if left unscrutonized.\\n\\nLife can be seen in the positive light like this: as the only chance to do what you want ,the only chance to vibe with a friend,to see a sunset,to get high , to make love,or just to exist,to drink a cold glass of water on a hot day; you are the result of an unbroken link of life, billions of years old ,a result of a rare set of circumstances ,with an even rarer, goldy locke- like set of conditions ,that could be extended as far as the laws of physics ,that allow this universe to exist,becoming alive is rare.\\n\\nYou live in the best time, historically ,no king has ever had the luxury you have,the life expectancy,life quality,this spectrum of experiences and\\xa0 sensations,the most peacefull period in history, music,other cool people shaped by theese nice times,all the human knowledge at your fingertips,psychedelics etc.\\n\\nlife is linear from 0 to 0\\xa0 ,whatever you do, in the end doesnt matter,but, since you shouldnt\\xa0 kill yourself ,since you die anyway ;you do what you can and the rest doesnt matter.\\n\\n\\xa0 If you learn to embrace stoicism and underestand that happiness shouldnt be the main goal of your existance because its unrealistic,you are just thrown in a context when youre born,you are influenced by powers far more reaching than you, because this is not your world,people joust for position just to get bread on the table,of course not every whim will get fullfilled.\\n\\nIf you learn to want ,but to be free of the outcome,or to not want some things at all,you will become happy,if you have realistic expectations ,extracted of wishful thinking.This is especially hard for cerebral people,who are terrorized by the limits reality and how the world could be ,if people were different. First off my advice is to accept the world fully then try to change the world by being a good parent,child,friend etc.\\n\\nThere is nothing youre going to be doing, thats gonna radically change how reality or existence works, aside from your own perceptions +use out of sight out of mind/or optimistic illusions if you have to,dont waste your life ruminating on shit that only makes you feel bad, even if youre correct,its not a pragmatic worldview.\\n\\nEmotions are low resolution solutions to problems that cant be computed.\\n\\nStudy neuroplasticity,learn about how the dopaminergic system works: that you only feel happiness if you have a purpose and are closing in , to that purpose,that evolutionarily youre built so the pleasure of advancing toward the goal is more intense than the pleasure of really achieveing it, in order so you keep striving; it is advantageous to keep busy; in a world where everything keeps evolving, you must run as fast as you can , to remain in the same place.\\n\\nLearn about the psychological article( bad is stronger than good),and how were evolutionarily built to percieve better longer and more intense the negative stimuli,coupled with the realism achieved when being pessimistic(arguably the most calibrated to reality worldview possible).\\n\\nLearn to not be driven crazy by things not going well ,especially after years of effort,Ceaser\\'s death,a flood or a fire are the best examples, every action is like a coin toss, at each throw the chance is 50℅,it doesnt matter that it came tails for 9 million times in a row, it doesnt matter that ,through effort and strategy and discipline and whatever you did ,it came tails for years ,at some point itll be different,destroying everything you built, realise that it was the wrong exprctation all along,thinking that things will HAVE to work out,solely because of your wish and track-record.\\n\\nThis is what we do,we consume order and we rearange the previous order- to surive and occupy our time after thats achieved,through constant effort and managing conplexity as we can.\\n\\nOne of our species superpowers, is to adapt,if youve studied psychology or evolutionary theory this is an axiom.As such ,the hedonic baseline (happines),is one of the most important informations ,-we revert back to the mean no matter what happens, if we win the lottery or almost get killed,it will always go back to the mean,the more time you have spent feeling bad the more youve skewed the baseline (cat videos have their purpose as well ,not just philosophy,dont feel guilty and take all the worlds pain,from all cultures and all historical periods on your shoulders).\\n\\n\"death is both a release to my pain and an end to my joy\"\\n\\nlife is just a matter of perception and if you havent tried LSD,Psylocibin or DMT you will never underestand the power of this statement,and youre probably an unknowing victim of depressive neuroplasticty.You will underestand that even if limited,you can choose to focus on the positive side,to be pragmatic,and encourage the thoughts, that will get you to extract as much out of this ,journey/chance as possible and not just linger in the abyss forever with your very correct and missunderestood worldview.\\n\\nSuicide should be an option when life is unlivable, and be consoled you have that option as long as you live with probably no repercussions except complete cessation of everything,that being said human resilience cant be underestimated,and the storm of emotions, of some life episodes, shouldnt necesarilly be generalised.\"', 'Do people just fake being excited? : Recently there was Christmas and yesterday there was New Year’s Eve. I don’t know about other people but me personally, there wasn’t a moment when I felt exited about my presents (even though I got actually good ones) or when we entered 2020. I just felt numb, people seemed to be happy/excited and all so I just went along with it and put on a fake smile, said thank you for the presents to be polite and during New Year’s Eve people shouted «\\xa0Happy new year!\\xa0» with a big smile on their face, they seemed genuinely happy and I didn’t want to ruin the moment so I smiled and said it back but in reality I couldn’t give less shit about starting a new year.

New Year\\'s Eve going into 2019 and 2020 have both been spent alone. For the second year in a row, my friends didn\\'t invite me to hang out. With around 3 hours to go until midnight, I checked social media and (to absolutely no surprise) see them all in a picture holding up champagne glasses together. I don\\'t know what hurt me more. Seeing them together without me, or the fact that I wasn\\'t even relatively surprised. They pull this shit all the time. So, I said \"fuck them\" to myself, got in a discord call with my internet friends (who presumably were also lonely) and had a blast playing video games until 3am. That made me really happy, but still in the back of my mind the whole night was my \"friends\" together without me. It\\'s not just holiday parties they don\\'t invite me to, but literally every time they go to the mall or go to one of their houses. Im not even exaggerating when I say they\\'ve never invited me anywhere. And these are the people I\\'ve been best friends with since fucking 7th grade. We sit together everyday at lunch. I don\\'t think they don\\'t invite me because they don\\'t like or want me to be there, I think its because (for some reason) they think I wouldn\\'t want to go, which is so far from the truth. I don\\'t really understand. I have a pretty big fear of missing out so this really scares me a lot. I\\'m probably that one person the friend group that everyone kinda forgets about when they\\'re not with them. Which leads me to my second point. I\\'m literally nobody\\'s favorite. Nobody thinks \"Oh! Im so exited to see meorahh today!\" or nobody gets exited at the mention of my voice. Im just kinda of... here. If the did think of me, maybe I would be invited to things. And I know people will say, \"Just make new friends!\" but that\\'s not how it works. I can\\'t just make new friends because its not that easy. Trust me, if it was i would\\'ve made new friends a long time ago.

It could be anything that makes workthile the suffering life brings.\\n\\nSpeaking of worth , self esteem\\'s biggest component is social conparison,usually this manifests unconsciously in behaviour, your happiness will always be relative to others\\'- achievements and lives-if left unscrutonized.\\n\\nLife can be seen in the positive light like this: as the only chance to do what you want ,the only chance to vibe with a friend,to see a sunset,to get high , to make love,or just to exist,to drink a cold glass of water on a hot day; you are the result of an unbroken link of life, billions of years old ,a result of a rare set of circumstances ,with an even rarer, goldy locke- like set of conditions ,that could be extended as far as the laws of physics ,that allow this universe to exist,becoming alive is rare.\\n\\nYou live in the best time, historically ,no king has ever had the luxury you have,the life expectancy,life quality,this spectrum of experiences and\\xa0 sensations,the most peacefull period in history, music,other cool people shaped by theese nice times,all the human knowledge at your fingertips,psychedelics etc.\\n\\nlife is linear from 0 to 0\\xa0 ,whatever you do, in the end doesnt matter,but, since you shouldnt\\xa0 kill yourself ,since you die anyway ;you do what you can and the rest doesnt matter.\\n\\n\\xa0 If you learn to embrace stoicism and underestand that happiness shouldnt be the main goal of your existance because its unrealistic,you are just thrown in a context when youre born,you are influenced by powers far more reaching than you, because this is not your world,people joust for position just to get bread on the table,of course not every whim will get fullfilled.\\n\\nIf you learn to want ,but to be free of the outcome,or to not want some things at all,you will become happy,if you have realistic expectations ,extracted of wishful thinking.This is especially hard for cerebral people,who are terrorized by the limits reality and how the world could be ,if people were different. First off my advice is to accept the world fully then try to change the world by being a good parent,child,friend etc.\\n\\nThere is nothing youre going to be doing, thats gonna radically change how reality or existence works, aside from your own perceptions +use out of sight out of mind/or optimistic illusions if you have to,dont waste your life ruminating on shit that only makes you feel bad, even if youre correct,its not a pragmatic worldview.\\n\\nEmotions are low resolution solutions to problems that cant be computed.\\n\\nStudy neuroplasticity,learn about how the dopaminergic system works: that you only feel happiness if you have a purpose and are closing in , to that purpose,that evolutionarily youre built so the pleasure of advancing toward the goal is more intense than the pleasure of really achieveing it, in order so you keep striving; it is advantageous to keep busy; in a world where everything keeps evolving, you must run as fast as you can , to remain in the same place.\\n\\nLearn about the psychological article( bad is stronger than good),and how were evolutionarily built to percieve better longer and more intense the negative stimuli,coupled with the realism achieved when being pessimistic(arguably the most calibrated to reality worldview possible).\\n\\nLearn to not be driven crazy by things not going well ,especially after years of effort,Ceaser\\'s death,a flood or a fire are the best examples, every action is like a coin toss, at each throw the chance is 50℅,it doesnt matter that it came tails for 9 million times in a row, it doesnt matter that ,through effort and strategy and discipline and whatever you did ,it came tails for years ,at some point itll be different,destroying everything you built, realise that it was the wrong exprctation all along,thinking that things will HAVE to work out,solely because of your wish and track-record.\\n\\nThis is what we do,we consume order and we rearange the previous order- to surive and occupy our time after thats achieved,through constant effort and managing conplexity as we can.\\n\\nOne of our species superpowers, is to adapt,if youve studied psychology or evolutionary theory this is an axiom.As such ,the hedonic baseline (happines),is one of the most important informations ,-we revert back to the mean no matter what happens, if we win the lottery or almost get killed,it will always go back to the mean,the more time you have spent feeling bad the more youve skewed the baseline (cat videos have their purpose as well ,not just philosophy,dont feel guilty and take all the worlds pain,from all cultures and all historical periods on your shoulders).\\n\\n\"death is both a release to my pain and an end to my joy\"\\n\\nlife is just a matter of perception and if you havent tried LSD,Psylocibin or DMT you will never underestand the power of this statement,and youre probably an unknowing victim of depressive neuroplasticty.You will underestand that even if limited,you can choose to focus on the positive side,to be pragmatic,and encourage the thoughts, that will get you to extract as much out of this ,journey/chance as possible and not just linger in the abyss forever with your very correct and missunderestood worldview.\\n\\nSuicide should be an option when life is unlivable, and be consoled you have that option as long as you live with probably no repercussions except complete cessation of everything,that being said human resilience cant be underestimated,and the storm of emotions, of some life episodes, shouldnt necesarilly be generalised.\"', 'Thank you all : This sub is the only place when I feel I can vent and suffer in peace with like-minded people.

First off my advice is to accept the world fully then try to change the world by being a good parent,child,friend etc.\\n\\nThere is nothing youre going to be doing, thats gonna radically change how reality or existence works, aside from your own perceptions +use out of sight out of mind/or optimistic illusions if you have to,dont waste your life ruminating on shit that only makes you feel bad, even if youre correct,its not a pragmatic worldview.\\n\\nEmotions are low resolution solutions to problems that cant be computed.\\n\\nStudy neuroplasticity,learn about how the dopaminergic system works: that you only feel happiness if you have a purpose and are closing in , to that purpose,that evolutionarily youre built so the pleasure of advancing toward the goal is more intense than the pleasure of really achieveing it, in order so you keep striving; it is advantageous to keep busy; in a world where everything keeps evolving, you must run as fast as you can , to remain in the same place.\\n\\nLearn about the psychological article( bad is stronger than good),and how were evolutionarily built to percieve better longer and more intense the negative stimuli,coupled with the realism achieved when being pessimistic(arguably the most calibrated to reality worldview possible).\\n\\nLearn to not be driven crazy by things not going well ,especially after years of effort,Ceaser\\'s death,a flood or a fire are the best examples, every action is like a coin toss, at each throw the chance is 50℅,it doesnt matter that it came tails for 9 million times in a row, it doesnt matter that ,through effort and strategy and discipline and whatever you did ,it came tails for years ,at some point itll be different,destroying everything you built, realise that it was the wrong exprctation all along,thinking that things will HAVE to work out,solely because of your wish and track-record.\\n\\nThis is what we do,we consume order and we rearange the previous order- to surive and occupy our time after thats achieved,through constant effort and managing conplexity as we can.\\n\\nOne of our species superpowers, is to adapt,if youve studied psychology or evolutionary theory this is an axiom.As such ,the hedonic baseline (happines),is one of the most important informations ,-we revert back to the mean no matter what happens, if we win the lottery or almost get killed,it will always go back to the mean,the more time you have spent feeling bad the more youve skewed the baseline (cat videos have their purpose as well ,not just philosophy,dont feel guilty and take all the worlds pain,from all cultures and all historical periods on your shoulders).\\n\\n\"death is both a release to my pain and an end to my joy\"\\n\\nlife is just a matter of perception and if you havent tried LSD,Psylocibin or DMT you will never underestand the power of this statement,and youre probably an unknowing victim of depressive neuroplasticty.You will underestand that even if limited,you can choose to focus on the positive side,to be pragmatic,and encourage the thoughts, that will get you to extract as much out of this ,journey/chance as possible and not just linger in the abyss forever with your very correct and missunderestood worldview.\\n\\nSuicide should be an option when life is unlivable, and be consoled you have that option as long as you live with probably no repercussions except complete cessation of everything,that being said human resilience cant be underestimated,and the storm of emotions, of some life episodes, shouldnt necesarilly be generalised.\"', 'Do people just fake being excited? : Recently there was Christmas and yesterday there was New Year’s Eve. I don’t know about other people but me personally, there wasn’t a moment when I felt exited about my presents (even though I got actually good ones) or when we entered 2020. I just felt numb, people seemed to be happy/excited and all so I just went along with it and put on a fake smile, said thank you for the presents to be polite and during New Year’s Eve people shouted «\\xa0Happy new year!\\xa0» with a big smile on their face, they seemed genuinely happy and I didn’t want to ruin the moment so I smiled and said it back but in reality I couldn’t give less shit about starting a new year. I just... felt numb. Empty. As if it was just another normal day except the food for dinner was quite nice. I honestly would’ve rather get a good night sleep than stay up until 3am. \\n\\nSo here’s my question: do people fake being excited during such events?', 'I\\'m so lonely and nobody\\'s favorite : Last night (New Year\\'s Eve) was somehow one of the best and worst night\\'s of my life. New Year\\'s Eve going into 2019 and 2020 have both been spent alone. For the second year in a row, my friends didn\\'t invite me to hang out. With around 3 hours to go until midnight, I checked social media and (to absolutely no surprise) see them all in a picture holding up champagne glasses together. I don\\'t know what hurt me more. Seeing them together without me, or the fact that I wasn\\'t even relatively surprised. They pull this shit all the time. So, I said \"fuck them\" to myself, got in a discord call with my internet friends (who presumably were also lonely) and had a blast playing video games until 3am. That made me really happy, but still in the back of my mind the whole night was my \"friends\" together without me. It\\'s not just holiday parties they don\\'t invite me to, but literally every time they go to the mall or go to one of their houses. Im not even exaggerating when I say they\\'ve never invited me anywhere. And these are the people I\\'ve been best friends with since fucking 7th grade. We sit together everyday at lunch. I don\\'t think they don\\'t invite me because they don\\'t like or want me to be there, I think its because (for some reason) they think I wouldn\\'t want to go, which is so far from the truth. I don\\'t really understand. I have a pretty big fear of missing out so this really scares me a lot. I\\'m probably that one person the friend group that everyone kinda forgets about when they\\'re not with them. Which leads me to my second point. I\\'m literally nobody\\'s favorite. Nobody thinks \"Oh! Im so exited to see meorahh today!\" or nobody gets exited at the mention of my voice. Im just kinda of... here. If the did think of me, maybe I would be invited to things. And I know people will say, \"Just make new friends!\" but that\\'s not how it works. I can\\'t just make new friends because its not that easy. Trust me, if it was i would\\'ve made new friends a long time ago.

Volunteered as a scribe and fell in love with the ER. The people, the pace, the environment just really clicked for me. I did what every Emergency Medicine-bound med student in the US is supposed to do. I did some away rotations, got my letters. Maybe I should have applied more broadly to more residency programs in retrospect but I applied to a substantial number of programs. My application, by all accounts, was fine. I went to a reputable state MD school, did OK on board exams with solid scores and no failures, and supposedly my letters of rec (called SLOEs in the EM world) were good. Went on enough interviews that according to official data my chances of not matching were less than 3%. Made my rank list Come March 2019, and I found out I was part of that 3%. I didn't match. I was devastated. I have been ever since. I was lucky in that I was able to scramble into a 1-year prelim program. I'm currently reapplying to Emergency Medicine this cycle. On track to have the same overall number of interviews this year. Was I just a shitty interviewee last year? Did I interview better this year? Was there some hidden red flag on my application? Who the fuck knows. The only certainty in this hellish game is that I'll find out if I match on March 16, 2020, but statistically, reapplicants to the [Match](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Resident_Matching_Program) fare worse than fresh grads.\\n\\nSo if I fail to match again, then what? If you don't get a residency in x specialty (one year preliminary programs like the one I'm currently in don't count) you can't work as a full attending physician in that specialty. Specifically, if you don't do an Emergency Medicine residency no one will hire you to work in a tier-one city ER. Maybe I might fare better in the Match if I also applied to different, less competitive specialties like Family Medicine or Internal Medicine, but I pretty much dislike everything else in medicine and to be specific, I hate everything to do with primary care (Family Medicine) and working as an inpatient hospitalist or subspecialist (Internal Medicine). If you fail to match you get the option of immediately trying to scramble (called the SOAP process) into an open position, but guess what specialties most of those unfilled openings are in? Yep, IM and FM. And usually these unfilled spots are at shitty programs (there's a reason why they didn't fill, after all.) It's just doubly depressing and I'm fairly sure I would off myself if I had to work as an IM or FM doctor for the rest of my shitty miserable life.\\n\\nI've never had a history of mental illness but the uncertainty of my future and the thought of not matching again just depresses me horribly. The more I ruminate about it the more I want to kill myself, and I certainly have the means to thanks to my 9mm handgun. As part of my current prelim year I have to do rotations in fields that have very little to do with Emergency Medicine (like my current inpatient hospitalist rotation) and to have to go to work for that every day is an internal torture for me. I've always been very good at compartmentalizing my emotions and feelings so thankfully no one at work has any idea of how I feel. Pretty sure they would force me to be hospitalized if anyone found out (which obviously would not be good for my future residency prospects). But I'm convinced that if I fail to match again on March 16, 2020 (when the results for the 2020 match come out), I will just kill myself. For one, anyone who has failed to match twice is going to be damaged goods and there's little chance you'll be competitive for \\\\*any\\\\* residency if you try to match again the next year. There just won't be anything worth living for anymore.

I\\'ve been trying to come to terms with the ending of a really special friendship between a couple and I, a whole group of friends due to lies being spread about me that included my best friend I made on the fetish scene and two friends died, one to suicide and one to a heart attack. I was made redundant from the first job I have had last longer than a year and a half since 2008 due to moving my role outside of London, I\\'ve had problems and uncertainty over my living situation and culminating in my Dad having a heart attack about two weeks before Christmas.\\n\\nIn the last six months, I\\'ve I purposely asked my therapist to start trying to help me come to terms with my own abuse, but unfortunately, my own mental health went down the more we spoke about it. This was around June time and around that time I met my now ex play partner. As I am on the fetish and BDSM scene, having a play partner is kind of like a FWB but you meet up, hang out, \"play\", have sex, whatever... Problem being, I pretty much fell for her the moment I saw her.\\n\\nShe is everything I want in a partner, funny, cute, curvy, into the same music (BIG BIG THING for me) and into the same kinks, even the ones I am ashamed of / scared of sharing with others. She always said she wasn\\'t over her ex and didn\\'t want anything serious but with her being exactly what I want in someone, I couldn\\'t help but fall for her. She is literally only the second person ever in my life that when I met for the first time, my heart skipped a beat and I felt like my jaw dropped like a Tex Avery cartoon wolf.\\n\\nShe pulled away from me twice through kink guilt and then the final time happened in mid-Oct, I didn\\'t realise how serious it was and how much it really was over for a few weeks afterwards when she told me she had feelings for someone else. This was the lynchpin that when it was pulled away, started my breakdown. I broke down to my housemate\\'s girlfriend and sobbed my heart out so hard and for so long, my other housemates came to find out what had happened. I ended up in such a panicked state, I had to call the Samaritans for help. I ended up calling a few different helplines to try and get somewhere but it didn\\'t amount to much.\\n\\nI ended up going to the Accident and Emergency (ER to the US readers) because I was so low, I was worried I would do something stupid. They didn\\'t do much but eventually, they referred me to the brief intervention team... which I only heard from after a series of shitty and frustrating events. I have spoken to doctors and spoken with a clinical psychologist now and they\\'ve referred me to a psychiatrist but STILL waiting on this too.\\n\\nI still talk her occasionally but she\\'s super short in her answers and it just hurts. I\\'ve only seen her once to give her belongings back, but any time she puts on update on the website we met through or her IG, I get anxious and upset, but I can\\'t unfollow / delete / block because something in me isn\\'t ready to let go. She\\'s everything I want in someone I just can\\'t bear to think that I could miss out on being with her. We\\'ll end up running into each other at some events eventually but I know I will have to leave because it will hurt too much.\\n\\nI honestly don\\'t know what to do.

It\\'s been ten years since I have felt like I was getting what I needed from a relationship and I\\'m lonelier that I have ever been. I have some better tools to cope with the down times that I did before but I\\'m still hurting so so much and I just want a ray of sunshine, someone that makes my heart skip, someone to show me the love I want to give them, but no one I want to be with, wants me, they never have and I feel like they never will.\\n\\nI was a really late bloomer in school and I didn\\'t start having relationships till I was 15 plus and then didn\\'t have consensual sex till I was 17 plus and the only reason I did end up dating people and such was because they were the first people to come along and show interest in me. I honestly ended up in relationships with people who were bad for me from the start for the pure reason that they showed interest and somewhere in my \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*ing brain just went \"QUICK! DON\\'T TURN THEM DOWN! YOU\\'LL NEVER GET ANOTHER CHANCE, NO ONE ELSE WILL CARE!\"\\n\\nI\\'m just so so tired, so lonely, so upset and so scared that I\\'ll never be happy again. I don\\'t want my Dad to die before he know I have someone who loves me and I love them. My parents are in their 70\\'s now and they are starting to show real signs of aging and losing either of them could really be the end of me.\\n\\nSorry, this post has gone all over the place, just very tired (mentally) and just want someone there to hold me, to give me a kiss, gently stroke my back as they pass me while out with a group of friends, just anything to know that someone cares enough to touch me. I need contact with people, if I were to see friends 99% of the day for a week, but had to physical contact, I might as well have been alone, because I need it to fell like someone cares and right now, no matter how many screenshots I save from those that reply to my posts, no matter how many phone calls, whatsapp\\'s or whatever, nothing can replace that contact, especially from someone that I want to be with and they want to be with me\\n\\nJust wish things were very very different.

Next verse: \\nCome home and lie in bed\\nThinking if it was my fault?\\nDizzy night, looking at the clock\\nSoon it will be midnight\\nWill something be different?\\nIt won't be something like that\\nBut this day will be over\\nWhen the minute and second hands overlap\\nThe world holds its breath for a little while\\nZero o’clock\\nLife feels pointless and I could say I’m hopeless but apart of me always says “tomorrow” “tomorrow will be better” “I will start ____ tomorrow”. It’s all a little white lie but a glimmer of hope for myself to continue is good enough for me. Anyway this song makes me feel like it’s okay to feel the way I feel. Tomorrow is a new day and I can try again. These feelings aren’t going to disappear within a night. Anyway I do suggest listening to their music. My favorite song is paradise which is along the same premise: it’s ok not to have a dream or force myself to have this extravagant hopefulness/ dream like others. It’s okay to live day by day and conquer little things in life. \\nNote: idk what they’re saying since I don’t speak fluent korean but it sounds good and picking up a couple phrases has been fun to learn.

I appreciate it but I would strongly prefer answers that will help me get closer to the subject matter.\\nI've been researching this on and off for months. It seems to be, at least in the US/UK, strictly limited to the (physically) terminally ill - assisted suicide, that is. Euthanasia is illegal here in the US, period. I'm from the upper east coast and have no such options, am in average to below average physical health, but have lived with lifelong depression among other things. I would like to pass with some dignity rather than miserably clinging onto something I consider meaningless. I literally only live because it would emotionally inconvenience my immediate family and friends. I'd prefer to leave the most shallow emotional scar I possibly can and to leave my physical imprint similarly shallow (my personal belongings being packaged up/easy to dispose of or store, etc.).\\nIf there are no options in the US I am considering overseas options, even if that requires I become a citizen. In the Netherlands or Switzerland it is a 5-year or so process, which in hindsight is nothing to fret about. The grind and dedication to achieve the means to the end is comforting enough.\\nUltimately I'd like to make as little a mess as possible as a hanging death via doorknob and a drug cocktail is nothing I would like to leave anyone cleaning up. If it becomes my only option then very well, but I'd like to go with dignity and at least leave my loved ones better prepared.\", \"Cookies : I'm eating cookies, it's the best I've felt all day I couldn't go to college today because I'm just too sad. But the cookies got me uplifted for about 5 minutes so thank you cookies &lt;3\", 'The change that brought me out of depression. [long, hopefully inspiring] : I was a good college student, but overwhelmed because of the intensity of the material I studied. As graduation approached, I managed to land a job (not degree related) that paid pretty well coming out of school. I thought I was set. \\nThen the work began, the job wasn’t horrible, but it was stressful and exhaustive. the days were long...10-12 hour days, Monday through Friday. \\nAfter a year I realized I’m spending most of my time at work, and doing very little outside of it. Stopped going to the gym, starting eating like shit, hardly ever saw my friends, hell I hardly had friends to begin with. You know what, scratch that, I DIDN’T realize it at the time, but that’s what was happening and that’s how it always fucking begins...you let that life giving force slip away from you unnoticed. \\nAnyway, I started applying elsewhere within the same industry. My thinking was, I’ll give this industry another shot and if it’s the same BS, I’m out, I’ll do something else entirely ...what that was at the time, I didn’t know, I didn’t really have a long term plan. \\nI landed another job, more money, similar title, same exhaustive hours, different company, in a Big city, which prompted me to move out which was exciting. Everything was new and that new energy powered me through the first new year on the job. \\nAnd then the lack of realization struck again, i was being groomed for a life time of suffering. At the time, what I DID realize is that This is just how life goes...you graduate and then work yourself half to death. I was putting in so much work and neglecting myself entirely. The job was great at masking my neglect. They’d have work parties, music playing, TVs everywhere playing the news, sports, etc. food was provided, we had a bar, mini golf, pool tables, the works. The idea was that you go to work and you shouldn’t feel like you’re there, which was a great concept...but still, I had no life. This company bought my life. \\nI became a shell, I’d come home, pound 3-4 beers and surf the couch til bed time. I was irritable, annoyed and lazy, depressed. Once the weekend came...I was dead to the world. Friday I was too tired to go out, Saturday was my only day to catch up on anything at all, and Sunday ...Sunday...man, that was the day that never failed to remind me that...hey your life sucks. Sunday was the day of dread, I didn’t want to do anything because I knew that the next day, my suffering resumed. I became depressed. So so depressed. \\nI continued this for two years, I burned out. I was a drone. I lived to work and nothing else. I lost. I felt useless, worthless, watching life zoom by. I became out of shape, unhealthy, lazy, mean, sad. \\nThen one day, at a family party on a Sunday, I left early and on the drive home I found the courage to change it all. I said to myself “I want out, I want change” not just any change, positive change. Nobody should have to live this way. \\nThe next day I showed up at work and put in the utmost minimal amount of work possible, all the while applying for any and every other possible job out there. It was then that I reconnected with a former college friend who seemed to have a great job in an industry suited to my degree. She said she’d put in a word for me and that was that. \\nWithin two months, my life changed so dramatically, I cried tears of happiness. The job is awesome, caters to work/life balance, and it’s just good. I have my life back, I’m healthy again, in the best shape of my life, doing the things I want to do. The only downside was that I took a 22% salary cut to do this, but in the two years I’ve been here I’ve made up for more than half of that already. Besides, I learned that no amount of money can buy my happiness. I’ve been the happiest I’ve ever been making less than my previous two jobs. I’m still here, thriving, happy and looking forward to the future. \\nMy example is obviously very specific but here is what you should take away from this:\\nTake a step back and observe your life, there is something there that doesn’t belong and hone in on it, change it. It can be something small or something as big as changing careers and flipping your life upside down temporarily. Things get tougher before they get better, but we’re humans and we’re capable of suffering. If you’re suffering now, you can take a little more if the result brings about positive change. It’s fucking scary, but nothing will change if you don’t try. We deserve the best, but the best starts with respecting yourself and changing the life around you.\\nBest of luck.

Everything in my life that is supposed to bring me happiness is majorly flawed.  I'm not going to get into every single aspect, just the main ones that have been paining my lately. Every one of my friendships has a major key missing. Dont get me wrong, I love my friends, and I would do anything for them.  But it has been years since I've felt true love and happiness around anybody.  Most of the time I am around someone I want to be home.  Something is missing in every friendship.  Every.  Single.  Friendship.  It's different for everyone and I wont get into it for every specific person but it fucks me up.  I want to feel comfortable and happy with someone.  Truly comfortable and happy.  Like wanting to spend hours with them, feeling heard and understood, feeling the way it feels when your love is reciprocated fully.  And this is why I cant talk to my friends about this.  I cant hurt them.  I cant tell them that I think our friendship is flawed or that I dont really feel at home with them.  Thats horrible.  But sometimes I think they can feel it.  And it sucks even more.  I talk to them and I can see it in their eyes.  They can see I'm not totally happy being with them and it hurts them.  And it hurts me to know I make them feel that way.  It's an endless cycle.  like I said, it's been years since I've felt fully platonically in love with a friend. And  I feel so disconnected from my family.  I'm the odd one out.  It's like I got put into my own personal hell.  I am nothing like these people.  And I'm stuck with them for years to come.  You're supposed to feel loved and supported and happy with your family.  They've broken my heart so many times.  I've just learned to keep to myself. It hurts not even get along with your family.  It hurts so bad.  I know the next 5 years of my life are going to be so lonely, sad, and stressful.  I might not make it.  My heart has been broken, and I mean I can feel the pain in my heart, so many times.  By my friends, by my family, by people i have been romantically interested in.  I dont know how it hasnt just died.  I know that sounds dramatic, but it has felt so much pain.  And to top it all off, I lost the one person who I felt slightly connected to.  Still off by a long shot, but closer than anyone I've ever known.  She turned into someone I couldnt stand to be around, and it hurt.  It still hurts.  I had to distance myself.  Everytime Ive spoken to her in the last year i hope for someone who isnt there, and it breaks my heart every time.  She became mean and vindictive and selfish.  Now I feel truly alone. I hate to feel this way so young.  I honestly wish I could just end it all.  I am a realist, and I just wish people would let me do it. I know the next 5 years, and possibly the rest of my life are going to be a sad waste.  I wish people would put their emotion aside and let me do it.  It would save me and everyone else so much heartache.  I wish I could get cancer. People cope easier with it, or at least better than a sudden abrupt death.  They wont have to wonder why I did it, they'll know it was the cancer, and that's good enough for me.  I really believe it's the best option, all emotions aside.  I wish I could get into everything, I wish I could talk to someone and let everything that is in my head out, but I cant.  It all boils down to one thing.

If you wanna get better you need to get some serious positive influences in your life and make quantitative changes. Imagine thinking you’re gonna fix your depression by listening to the thoughts and ideas of other depressed people. It makes no sense right? Here’s some serious scientific-based advice from a psychology student.\\nTop five tips to getting better; \\n1. Exercise, sleep, and diet. Not going to go into it all. But fucking do it. Not going to debate which diet is the healthiest either, but low sugar is a good place to start for all those soft drink enthusiasts.\\n2. Socialise. Find people whose company you enjoy and click with. Cling to those people (not in a weird way). Foster those relationships. Friendships are hard, you need to put effort into them if you want them to work. That means messaging on a daily basis, organising weekly meetups, listening to them when they are struggling (and in turn them listening to you). If you have any antisocial addictions, make them social! Hard core gamers, get all over discord. Alcoholics, attend AA meetings (PLURAL). You get the drift. \\n3. Don’t limit yourself in what you can and can’t do due to the judgments of others (parents, friends, etc). Helplessness and lack of control is a depression complex on its own. Go get your motorbike license, or get that sick tattoo, or cross dress on a night out. Idc just go do it because you’ll hate yourself for not. \\n4. Routine. Get yourself a routine. I cannot stress this enough. Getting out of bed is the hardest part of the day for some people. On my worst days, I’ll make sure more than anything to brush my teeth. From there on out everything just flows. Shower-&gt; breakfast -&gt; Car -&gt; Work/Uni etc... I won’t get into the psychology of it because it’s extremely broad and long winded, I could do a whole ten thousand word thesis on it.(I couldn’t but someone could, it’s that extensive).\\n5. Start a diary. Essential. Log your thoughts and emotions and how you responded to them. Was it healthy? We’re you right in thinking / feeling that way? Depression is a very emotional state of being and a diary is a really productive way to rationalise all these intense thoughts and emotions running around in your head. Putting them down on paper also helps you talk about them later which is a really positive and healthy way of dealing with it all.\\nSo, five tips that you can start implementing into your life right now! If you start doing these things and don’t see improvement, you’re just as much of a statistical anomaly as Helen Keller.

She then said she wasnt grateful or something and said she wished she grew up with different friends, in a different house, and a different face. Honestly i think she is the pretty sister and it rly hurt and annoyed me when she had said that because i always felt below her and everyone looked at her cuz she was prettier.

Those noises are scary because they are unfamiliar. Often when I hear one of those noises, I'd jump out of the car that I was in. I think I have been jumping out of other people’s cars so often I don’t even know where my own car is anymore. \\nNow when people ask me to get into their cars, I can barely hear them anymore. The noises of life have gotten too much. All I want is to get into someone’s car and have them take me to mine. But I don’t even know how to make my own voice heard anymore. Now, whenever someone stops to let me in and ask me where I am going, the only way I know how to have my voice be heard is to shout over the noises of life. And when I shout at someone trying to help me, they drive away. Or maybe I run away. Why are the noises so loud?\", 'What do I even do? : I’m starting to really think I have depression or anxiety, or maybe depression caused by anxiety, or even vice versa. However, I have no one to talk to about it.

Any other time is impossible. I was literally complaining of a sore throat, difficultly breathing, and a fever and she said I couldn’t stay home from school because it was just symptoms. But I’m at least 99% sure it’s fucking not. I literally have the worst immune system of all the people I know! Anytime any sickness is even mentioned of spreading around my area, I already have it. If she doesn’t even believe me when I’m physically sick, how on this god forsaken earth would she believe me when I’m mentally sick?', 'Crying : I’ve been crying for an hour straight and I’m so tired of having no friends and no one to talk to or hang out with.

I have seen a lot of posts and advices on good books but I’d like to read a few books more specific for a guy my age, books to change my perspective on life and to feel happy again. \\nJust a little background: I’m a 22 year old guy who has suffered a lot lately. I had a decent relationship with a girl who is perfect in everyones eyes: Loving, loyal, beautiful, smart, studying &amp; working hard to guarantee ourselves a bright future. The problem was that she was literally too good and respectful for me and I didn’t love her enough for some reasons. I’m still trying to figure those reasons. We decided to break up because I didn’t see her as the mother of my children. I cheated on her twice (kissing a different girl) and I know I would never do that when I was together with someone I love truly. Not trying to justify the cheating, because I know that’s completely wrong and we both suffered from it. After the second time I knew I didn’t love her enough. \\nAnyways, we broke up half a year ago and since then everything has going downhill for me. I did good in school, had a good life and was happy until then. After her, I was in pain because I knew I would never have someone like het ever again, but once again, I just didn’t see a future with her even though she is perfect in any way possible. I just need someone who is less polite and who wouldn’t be afraid to have a discussion with me when I’m wrong. I know that seems really weird to hear, but it is what it is. I became an addict, used to do XTC once a year at a festival but in september I bought a lot at once, just to feel happiness again. I discovered cocaine and ketamine and became addicted. I am doing way less now than before but still too much. I used to take pills in bed just to feel happy during the night. Sometimes 6 pieces a night. Been to the doctor and a psychologist and they are now helping me to do less and eventually never again. My parents know nothing about me doing drugs and I want to keep it that way, my friends do know though and they are concerned. \\nThe relationship with my mother has been unstable for a few years. It is better now but we still fight a lot, also because she is really depressed and that is hard to deal with. The relationship with my dad is perfect though. They’re both single. Relationship with my siblings (kids of my mom, different dad) is pretty good too. I used to text a different girl but when I fell in love she stopped responding and that’s why I have been feeling bad for the past few days.\\nI have good days, but sometimes, like today, I feel useless. I hate thinking about having to work whole my life to then spend your money when you’re - in my opinion - too old. (here you can reture when you are 67, probably 70 when it’s my time to retire.) I just have a feeling that this life is not for me and I want to know the meaning of life. In my eyes we live to work and then die, if that’s what life is, I don’t want to live that life. But no, I would never commit suicide if that’s what you’re thinking.\\nBut I know there is way more than that, I just have a wrong perception of life and I want it to change. I’ve been watching a lot of motivational speakers lately and I’ve read a lot about books changing the life of many people. (The subtle art of not giving a f*ck, meditations,...). It really has an impact on me and I know there are reasons to live and ways to be happy.\\nI really want to feel happy again, find reasons to live this life and just be positive in life, having the ability to control (and maybe even turn off) my emotions in stead of letting them take control over me. If you read until here, I am very thankful, you are a good person for willing to help someone in need. \\nNow, what books do you people recommend to find the meaning of life, to be positive again, to gain control over your emotions and just to be happy again. I am desperate for good books and I know they will help me become a positive person. Any recommendation is fine, I just want to feel happy again, forever. \\nThank you very much for reading &amp; have a good day :)', 'Sometimes I just read old messages to further drown me in the past : Man do I miss some people', 'I just feel extremely empty : I just needed to tell something', 'I don’t feel like waking up in the morning anymore. : [removed]', \"My life has been a consistent downward slope. : When I was young I remember feeling genuinely happy a lot. I've slowly slid downhill from there, I managed to move uphill precisely once in my life. I tricked a girl into loving me for three years, until she finally wise up and told me to get lost. I lost my friend group from high school, and haven't managed to keep a friend for over a year since then. I've come to the conclusion that I'm just not a very likable person, and that knowledge, plus my loneliness cause me to become more bitter, and less likable which perpetuates the cycle. I just feel like I was never really meant to exist, like life has slots for gears, and I'm just a disc, so I could never get any traction. I guess it makes sense?

I have no friends still and I feel like such a stranger and that I don’t belong here.

Recently I had quit WoW due to my failing grades (which I will get to) and now I feel like my only lifeline to people has been cut off.

The thing is, I used to have that fire, and now I feel so empty without any passion. To put it simply, I feel hopeless, I used to be the master of studying and school. I was almost valedictorian and passed my classes with ease, including honors classes. Now, I feel like an absolute idiot, I can’t absorb anything I study, and I feel low all the time now.

I would get into fights with him a lot of times. Like once when i was really young i threw a rock at my sister and made her bleed. He yelled at me for a while and kept pushing me against the wall and knocking me down. \"You could have killed her!\" He said that. I still remember it.\\nNow i hardly ever get in fights with him. I just fight with my mom now.\\nAnother time when i was maybe 14 my brother was annoying me and as i poured syrup on my waffles i told him, \"did you know you have to stab somebody a lot of times for them to die? People think its only once but its actually a lot.\" Something like that. My dad was in the room.\\nThe next thing i knew he whisked me away to the garage.\\nI was there for over an hour. He yelled at me a bunch of times and threatened to have me comitted to an institution. We had a bunch of bikes in the garage that he kept pushing me against. I kept knocking them over. At one point he grabbed me around the neck and said, \"I\\'ll kill you,\" through gritted teeth. He was mad, I think because he thought I\\'d actually try to stab my brother. He kept threatening me, saying what hed do to me if I tried to do anything to \"his family.\"\\nSo as you can see i was a difficult kid. I did/said things that were fucked up sometimes.

Day in and out..  long nights of work (railroad is a unforgiving career). She was the person I could open up to about anything, who I though was my best friend. We shared the good times, the bad, the sick and the sad together.  We were both introverts so we basically had each other then friends at work. We were not the big party type more of the party of 2 type so she was basically all I had, so you could say she was my best friend, as everyone who wants that bliss of a relationship. One night we were drinking together, having a great time playing games together and just having a great time when we started a serious conversation about our future...  this is where things go down hill and fast.

I expect a certain level of comfort to be provided to me, and when it is not delivered, I become miserable, blaming others for treating me this way, or the universe for the way I am, for making me as traumatized of an individual as I am.\\nI need to stop.\\nEverything I’ve done, everything that has happened to me, is for me to take responsibility for. I need to stop being selfish and care about feeling good, or having someone else make me feel better. They’re not responsible for my happiness, my success, or my suffering. I am. I am not powerless. I decide what I want. And no one else need to get me or understand me for me to be happy. I do not need to please other people. I will do what I want to do, and say what I really want, instead of feeling powerless and continue to suffer. I also do not need make other people feel bad for the things I did to myself. I should ask for their intention, and respond by listening with intent. The perspective of my victim identity only adds to my suffering, and amplify the situation even more than what it is. \\nI should not find fault with others, because that is why I end up dwelling on faults I find in myself. \\nThis victim mentality is not permanent, and it is not something I will carry with me for the rest of my life. This is something I can change, and the first step to it is recognizing that I have been acting like a victim. I am not powerless in this change, and I will remove that victim identity for myself.', 'A trip to die for : Next week im leaving my place of home for a very long time.

I am constantly annoyed at my parents, especially my dad. I think this comes from the fact that he was the one who did not want to meet her or include her in our family at first. He was the one who didn't let me drop out of engineering and do something else, he didn't let me look for a part-time job when I was in high school, he always pushed me towards medicine, always put down my ideas of professions that interested me.

Some describe it as being locked up in a dark room with a window to see everyone else be happy, while others say it\\'s like standing between two walls that crush you more and more. So, what do you do when the walls crush you so badly that you feel like you can\\'t breathe, you don\\'t wanna live anymore and death would be more painless than life?\\nObserve. Be aware. Accept. Let go.\\nSee, if two mental walls pushed you in the middle for a very long time, we would be so annoyed that we\\'d then try to push them back because so many people tell us to fight our depression; so, we try to fight it, thus end up breaking our metaphorical arms, feeling desperate because we\\'ve tried everything, and when you fight too much and try to resist too much, you feel like you\\'ve been defeated. I say: **STOP FIGHTING.**\\nAll you have to do is be aware of that feeling that comes and goes. Depression will be there most of the time, but sometimes it\\'s not. We can all agree that depression isn\\'t always equally horrible. Sometimes, it gets annoying, it bothers us and we can\\'t focus on our work, and sometimes it gets unliveable and we try to end it all because it bothers us way too much. You have to be AWARE of those feelings, you have to KNOW when they\\'re happening. You have to understand that when shit gets too tough, it\\'s not you being weak, but it\\'s your depression telling you to stop resisting pain. Accept the pain, let it come and go, but you have to do this while being aware of it happening, you have to notice when it happens so that when you think of ending it all, just remember that it\\'s not you.\\nSometimes we get too lost in depression, we think that depression defines our personality and that without depression we would be losers, hence people think that depression is a good thing. This is a wrong mindset. Without depression, you would feel exactly the same - except the negativity. Everything will become manageable, you will be more focused, more energetic, more everything + less negativity. Your \"asshole\" or \"smart depressed guy\" personality will be there as well, but only if you want it to be there.\\nDepression doesn\\'t last forever, and this is for real. It seems like it\\'s forever, but it\\'s not. You have to be aware when the shit times happen, but you also have to be aware when the good times happen, because even though they don\\'t feel like good times, you have to be aware of them so you could evaluate that they could be worse. Some people struggle too hard to be happy, so when something good happens to them, they feel like they don\\'t deserve it because depression doesn\\'t let happy things make them happy. But they do make you happy to some degree, and be aware of it when it happens, because when you think of ending it all, you have to remember these times when good things happened to you despite the fact that you weren\\'t happy, because you have to realize that there are good things in the world and that depression is like glasses that don\\'t let you see them. These glasses, just like any other glasses, don\\'t last forever, they get blurry, they stop working, so naturally they get off your face.\\nMoral of the story: Awareness is the key, for both the negative and positive situations. When walls push you and you\\'re stuck and can\\'t move, stop resisting, be aware. Always remember that this doesn\\'t last forever, remember this post in your head whenever you think that you\\'re never gonna get rid of it. Truth is, some people can\\'t get rid of it, but depression will leave by itself. Learn to say no to people, learn to give yourself what you want because it helps you to learn self-love because you\\'re giving your mental health some space and freedom. No matter what people you disappoint or make angry, know that you don\\'t have to care about them at the moment. As long as depression is there, you can\\'t help anyone because what happens when you have a flu and try to cure another person who has a flu? Wouldn\\'t that be extremely difficult? Or when being on an airplane and things go wrong, did you know that the passangers have to put on masks on their faces first before they put on their child\\'s face? This is because you can\\'t help anyone if you\\'re fucked as well, so remember what I\\'ve just said and survive through this thing.

Things suck right now, but they can and will get better because of time.  You aren\\'t the first person to be in this situation, you won\\'t be the last person. Hang in there, get what help you can.\\nIf you have chemical depression, it\\'s because your body isn\\'t making the right amount of the right chemical, or it\\'s going through the right chemical but too quickly, etc.  This is like having diabetes. It\\'s not caused by an event, it\\'s not a reaction to something which has happened or is likely to happen. It\\'s a medical condition that you need medicine to control.  Yes, some people can achieve help with diet changes, some people can exercise their way out, but in all cases it\\'s still a bio-chemical problem.\\nTalk therapy is not going to fix chemical depression.  Changing jobs is not going to fix chemical depression.  Having kids is not going to fix chemical depression.\\nNow, here\\'s the kicker -- your brain is fucking stupid. It does not control the body, it justifies the body. If you eat a pizza and then later feel sick, your brain decides it was the pizza.  It may be that you have the flu and the pizza has nothing to do with it, but your brain is looking for cause and effect, so until it gets convinced otherwise, you hate pizza.\\nAnother example:  You think you\\'re drinking decaf, but your actually drinking an energy drink. You get the jitters.  You much be scared of something.  Something bad must be about to happen because otherwise why would you have the jitters.  OMG! You\\'re psychic! You know something bad is about to happen!  Yeah, no. You\\'re brain is stupid. That\\'s all.\\nWell, the exact same thing is true with chemical depression.  Your bio-chemistry says \"you are depressed!\" so your brain says, \"Oh, it must be because.... um.... I hate my job! Or it\\'s because I don\\'t have a girlfriend! No, no, I know! My friends all hate me!\"\\nSo, when you\\'re feeling down, ask yourself objectively: am I depressed because something is wrong, or am I depressed because my brain is stupid?\\nIf you are feeling depressed and its made worse because there\\'s no good reason for you to be depressed, you likely have chemical depression and should talk to a doctor about getting pills.

This didn't happen really often, but I remember feeling very bad after that for quite a time. I think that's why I still just keep going without even knowing why, I just couldn't stand disappointing him and my mother. So did I make this decision or was it the way society viewed me and I then thought I had to live up to? How can I go on without knowing this?

I keep playing it in my mind and I have no clue why I couldn't figure any of it out. There was only one problem I was actually unfamiliar with, the rest were things similar to stuff I had done in the past, just harder. The only hope I have now is that I do well with my final since that can replace the lowest exam score.\\nSorry for the rant. Just venting at this point.\", 'Coming to terms with what\\'s ailing me. : First time poster, and honestly, just discovered this subreddit (even though I knew one must have existed out there). \\nOver the past month or so, I\\'ve come to terms that what I am experiencing is, at the very least, in part due to depression. I have yet to see a therapist (and should begin shopping around, to be honest), and it was easy to put in the back of my mind when coupled with other medical problems I\\'m trying to sort through (incidentally, if anyone wants to take a stab at my recent post in /r/AskDocs, I certainly wouldn\\'t mind...).\\nI\\'m mostly posting because I hate how alone these feelings make me feel.\\nI apologize, I don\\'t really have planned out what I am going to write, I just *know* that writing something could be helpful.\\nWhat I\\'ve been feeling the past few months, and honestly what I\\'ve probably been feeling for the past 18 months, is an unyielding loneliness. Yes, part of that is because, with my current job, I spend half my time (or more) away from my wife, and see her mostly on weekends. Part of that is because I probably haven\\'t fully come to terms with my Dad\\'s death in 2012. Part of that is because I feel like my life, even at age 31, has no direction.\\nWhat really prompted me to start talking about it was the physical manifestations from my depression.  I cried for the first time a week or so ago since 2012, for pretty much no reason. I was sitting on my couch, knew I couldn\\'t just \"be alone\", and called up a friend, and just immediately tears started streaming down my face. We didn\\'t even talk about anything consequential, mostly TV and video games, but it was helpful and eye-opening at the same time.\\nI know one of the contributors is from my undiagnosed medical condition (see that AskDocs thread), even though it likely is a symptom of anxiety/stress/depression. I just feel fatigued all the time (though, I have been working out and trying to lose weight). I\\'m just antsy and anxious all the time. There is a deep sadness that I can\\'t seem to overcome, but it doesn\\'t even really \"feel sad\", if that even makes sense?\\nI try to stay reasonable, and try to remind myself of what I felt like *before* I ever felt this way, and know that this can be temporary. It doesn\\'t always help. I feel just stuck in a rut, a never ending cycle of ups-and-downs with my emotions and no clear path forward.\\nBeing alone for most of the week (due to the job) certainly doesn\\'t help. Its a great job, but it made me move from a wonderful city to a rural environment where the average age has to be in the mid-50s. I don\\'t have any friends down here, just aquaintences and work colleagues and the like. As I\\'ve gotten older, a good chunk of my friends have moved away from the city and/or started families, which is truly awesome, but means I see less of them.\\nI dunno what more I should/can type. I just kind of spitballed a bunch of my thoughts, and its made me feel a tiny bit better. I\\'m open to advice and suggestions. This is new to me, in the terms of even acknowledging what I\\'m feeling.

(The daughter was the older of the two.)\\nSo I don't know where it starts but this traveling attraction arrives and it is like a horror attraction but not, I don't remember too much but there was a lot of hype for it.\\nThe family goes to it and the father gets killed by one of the exhibits then becomes apart of the attraction. He then kills the grandma and the son, the daughter escapes and is driven home by her dead father with my brother in the taxi, (only time he was in the dream) the girl says farewell and then realizes she is in an alternate reality where her family is alive still and then as she settles her original father comes back and kills her alternate father while making a really weird noise before he gets killed by like the neighbors I think and that was where I woke up.\\nSo yeah, just one of the few weird dreams I remember having simply because it is weird.\", 'I don’t dream anymore. : I don’t dream when I sleep anymore.

Or a shoulder. : [removed]', 'My girlfriend (22) is depressed, but she’s taking it out on me (M 25) : My girlfriend of two years seems to always be depressed. I try my best to be there for her but I feel like she gets so overwhelmed by everything that she has no patience with me and takes it out on me. \\nAt 22 she goes through a lot. She’s currently working on her masters degree, while also having to take care of her nieces and nephews (5 in total) from like 7 am to 6 pm every weekday until their parents come to pick them up and making sure the house is spotless before her parents come or else they yell at her. She’s struggling very hard to make and keep friends. The friends she wants to have (the ones of about 5-6 years) are ghosting her for no reason and want nothing to do with her even though she’s done nothing wrong to them. There are two people she talks to now that she knows from school, but it feels like she doesn’t want to try with them in fear of getting ghosted and pushed away again. \\nShe feels like everyone is constantly mad at her and it persuades the actions she takes. The other day she felt like her family would be mad at her for buying a hydro flask, even though it was with her money and her sister even found it for her on Facebook Marketplace. \\nWith this I do feel like her patience is very thin. I do get on her nerves sometimes I will admit, but I personally feel like the way she reacts when I do something so small and unintentional, is too much.\\nFor example, two nights ago I was at her house. She has a Brita water container that I used to fill my bottle with, so as a courtesy I wanted to fill up the container again. She was thankful and helped me hold the container while I put water in it with her retractable water faucet. I filled up the container and took the faucet out, but in the process I accidentally wet her pants a little bit. I thought she would just say something like “You got me wet! Can you hand me a towel?”, but instead I got “What the hell dude?? Why would you wet me like that??” And I told her “I’m sorry, it was an accident, I didn’t mean to”, but she continued being aggressive about it, which got me frustrated because I kept apologizing. I got her a towel and dried her off and said sorry again. I personally don’t think I should have been met with this aggression. This went on for about an hour, with the argument getting worse to the point where I wanted to storm out of her house.\\nMy girlfriend is extremely insecure and I try my hardest to reassure her, but sometimes it’s difficult because she doesn’t believe the things I say. Last night I took her to class, but before that I wanted to do something with her (sexual wise), so I went down on her and kept telling her that she is beautiful (she has newly formed stretch marks and it’s really effecting her). I made sure to let her know that I’m attracted to her, but then later that night she texted me and basically said she doesn’t want to talk to me and how could I do something so horrible. I was really confused. She explained to me that I had liked a picture with a girl showing her “skinny stomach” and she kept saying “go date a skinny girl then”. I was extremely confused because I don’t really like pictures like that, especially knowing my girlfriends insecurity. So I asked her if she could at least tell me what social media it was on so I can check my likes (which I did and found NOTHING). She basically told me “why does it matter, you still did it”. And then she told me goodnight. But me still confused I tried calling her multiple times, with her rejecting the call, and then I texted her saying “well you saw the picture, can you screenshot it to me so I know what you’re talking about?” She finally did after ignoring me, and it was a picture of a youtubers wife posting a picture of her being proud of her body since she had been working out a lot. And I finally understood her. What I don’t understand is that I liked that picture two years ago (July 30th, 2018) when her and I were six months together. How she found that I liked it was super confusing to me. But she basically asked me not to like pictures line that anymore, and I explained to her that I already don’t. Which she got frustrated about because she just wanted me to tell her that. \\nI don’t know if it’s something I’m doing? But I personally feel like what I’m doing isn’t that bad to get such an aggressive response from. I admit I get angry and mean, but only if she jumps out of the gate being aggressive. I’ll match her tone and then she’ll get mad at me for having a tone. I explain to her “by you telling me I have a tone is giving me a tone.” because I know when I talk to her I try to talk very calmly.\\nWhat the hell can I do. I want to be with her and she’s an amazing person, but once she gets angry she’s mean, aggressive, and will push everyone away (but still expect them to come to her even if she started it)', 'I only like memes that people i know enjoy as a coping mechanism : I show them those pictures and when they at least a bit found it funny it makes me happy for at least a minute', 'I cleaned my room and that’s a huge accomplishment for me : It may seem silly but I was off work for a month and a half, I took a personal leave of absence.

These services are incredibly helpful. In my case, I remember finally applying after finding out about these services (I found out too late unfortunately but oh well), and I was able to get extensions for schoolwork deadlines, extended/extra time during exams, and even class notes from a proctor who would take notes for me instead.

Now, every institution is different, perhaps not all schools have these services (that would really suck), and the perks/services you get may depend on you institution, but it's worth finding out.

I’m staying in a dorm with a friend of mine that I’ve known for years via Instagram and finally got to meet her in real life after like six years of video chats and phone calls. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t in love with this girl. I mean she’s everything I expected, and then some. She’s energetic, very smart, beautiful, and we know each other very well. She’s also taken by somebody a lot smarter than me that lives a lot closer to her. I know that if I tried to make a move at this point, it wouldn’t be wise. My spiritual beliefs are what’s keeping me secure. I believe in reincarnation, and therefore if I took her from this guy (or attempted), I’d simply be depriving myself in another life. It’s shitty karma. She’s been letting me sleep in her bed with her (not sexually; we don’t cuddle or make physical contact really of any kind) and honestly it’s enough. This girl makes me want to see the next day, every day. I didn’t actually think I’d ever be able to meet her. It’s almost like Pandora’s box, now.

The last “productive” thing I’ve done is go through basic training which is literally the first step in anyone’s military career. I have not become operational, I have not even started class or gone through any additional training. My “job” is to exist and check in at certain times for accountability purposes, I don’t even do anything as basic as janitorial work. I’ve also been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and a couple months back I struggled with substance abuse. I’m in the middle of a desert, too young to drink, in a rundown building that’s illegally overcrowded. Could give more details on all of this if requested, but the point is I’m aware that I’m not doing too hot. That being said, my main focus has been bettering myself and not inflicting my pain on anyone else. Most of my friends have graduated and went on to another base or permanently discharged back home. I struggle with socializing and making new friends so when I make a friend I don’t quite get attached or dependent but I do treat them better and tolerate more than someone with more connections would. This all being said, I’m not doing myself any favors by being passive.\\nLast night I proceeded to pull the plug and piss all over it with a long term friend from back home. She’s my age and we’ve known eachother since 2nd grade. I’ve done a lot for her over the years, mostly just verbal/emotional support. Like every single day on the bus until we could drive and then some. We stopped talking around that time but reconnected a couple months ago, and gradually I started expressing to her how I’ve always been depressed and suicidal I just keep it to myself but it’s getting worse (esp with not having control over my life). She’s told me it hurts for her to hear that and that she’s always there for me if I needed it. She and her friend invited me over New Years and after expressing how suicidal I was she “comforted me” until I stopped crying and then made up a story of her friend’s sister being in the hospital and that they had to check on her, and I had to go home. I was shitfaced drunk and still shaking from the breakdown I’d just had and she lied to my face and sent me out into the cold to figure shit out. Anyways, I noticed some discrepancies and called her out on it last night. She “apologized” but not really as there were more excuses for her behavior than genuine remorse. This isn’t the first time she’s fucked me over so I wasn’t backing down and then she had her friend from that night start texting me too, which I ignored. She gaslighted me two weeks ago when I was home and she gaslighted me last night.\\nBefore that text last night I hung out with another girl on my base who is currently married. We actually met in a mental health institution and nearly got married but I cut it off. We gave eachother space, she ended up getting married to a different guy over Christmas, and now here we are the best of buds. I’ve felt wronged by her in the past, ex. she only talks to me when she’s really low and needs someone to pull her up, but when I’m low or even neutral just bored and want to hang out she’s always too busy. Generally I have kept it to myself, telling myself I’m just being pessimistic or jealous of her new bf/husband, but it’s been feeling too often to be made up in my head. Last night she was low again so we went out for dinner. Even after eventually admitting to her that I was making plans to end my life just the day before (two days ago now) we mostly talked about her. I didn’t get upset about it though I’m used to it. What did upset me was that she kept trying to get me and my waitress to flirt. She said she was cute and I agreed, I guess that’s all she needed to hear to make awkwardly direct statements to our waitress that me and her were not together, I was single, flag her down randomly just to bring her to the table for me to talk to her, constantly be searching/staring at and talking about her the whole time once she started. I continuously told her to stop, maybe not assertively enough but my facial expressions, tone of voice and mannerisms went from relaxed smiles to tensed up uncomfortable playing with my straw saying I just wanted to go home. She even waived down another waitress to ask if ours was single (she wasn’t, btw) because “I was interested in her”. I didn’t ask for any of this. I didn’t encourage any of this. If I wanted to talk to my waitress I’d talk to my waitress myself. I felt humiliated and emasculating afterwards. I was upset and had nothing to say and she was texting on her phone so we didn’t say anything on the way home. I was generally doing very well yesterday, lots of smiles and no stress. After dinner I was visibly upset with the exception of tears. We got back on base and she said she’d text me last night and I said alright see ya. Not to any surprise she didn’t, but after texting girl#1 my neighbor I texted her too. I expressed that I understood she had good intentions but her actions upset me and that she said she’d text me but didn’t. I said I wasn’t mad upset or disappointed, I’m just sensing in general that I’m putting more energy into our relationship than she is. I apologized if I caused her any more stress while she’s in class and wished her the best of luck. In the morning I got a structured reason 1, 2, 3, 4 reply of how she was innocent and how I’ve made her look bad. I told her that she’s making herself look bad by bringing up my decisions and her reputation in the military when I was discussing our friendship. Then she said that broken people can’t fix broken people, she’d done everything she could for me, and that she can’t force me to “open up and help myself” because she’s better than that. Also I should mention that in the past she’s used my substance abuse against me in arguments.\\nI’m sorry this is so long. I tried to stay on point and cut out a lot of details for whoever sees this but I seem to have fewer and fewer people to talk to.

I feel like no matter what i do nothing is good enough and it’s just wrong. i’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend the father of my child for over 3 years. i know i’m not the only one that feels like i can’t do anything wrong or that i’m just a burden i think everyone feels that way about me. even my boyfriend said if i’m alone i won’t be able to deal with myself. I feel like i walk around with signs on my forehead that say “TREAT ME LIKE SHIT” “BE MEAN TO ME” “BE FAKE” “LIE TO ME” “CHEAT ON ME”. it’s like i attract all the fake people. i just sit at home with my daughter all the time i never go out anymore if i do it’s just to like go out to eat. i kind of miss when i was a freshman in high school and i thought i was the shit. people QUICKLY reminded me that i was not the shit at all and just in fact shit. i’m not sure what to do at this point as i try to feel good about myself but am constantly brought down by my boyfriend and parents. i feel like i’m not able to care about or focus on my own happiness and if i even try to for one second i’m called selfish. i try to make everyone happy and go a long with what they want because if i don’t things are just worse. i have had problems with depression since I was in 7th grade. at first my boyfriend was helping now it seems to just be making it worse. i feel like just a huge burden on society and that i shouldn’t have ever even been born in the first place.', \"Stopped taking care of myself and apartment found an angel to help : So about a year and a half ago I feel into a deep depression. Worse then I ever experienced. I was working 50+ hours a week as a substance abuse counselor and interventionist. I would come home and not be able to do anything. Not only was I not taking care of my apartment but I also stopped taking care of myself. After about 6 months of shame at how out of control my apartment had gotten I went to see a therapist. She did not think I had depression so much as burn out from my job. I saw her weekly and worked on just doing 1 thing each week to take care of myself and my apartment. Then the burn out really caught up to me and effected my job performance. I was let go but given the 300 hours paid leave I accrued and unemployment. I had never been more relieved in my life. I now had a cushion to take time to focus on my health and well being. My primary care doctor changed due to insurance and at my first physical she saw an anomaly in my records.  I had always had weight issues and it had been brushed off as bad diet and exercise by my former doctor and the endocrinologist she referred me to.  The new doctor noticed one thyroid test missing. Thyroid antibody test. After the results came back it showed that my Thyroid Antibodies were 100 times higher than normal. This means I had Hashimoto Thyroiditis. An auto immune disorder where your body attacks your thyroid like it is a virus. Causing lower metabalism(weight issues), sleep issues and chronic fatigue.  This coupled with my burnout is why I became so depressed. I was put on meds to help with weight as that was the only thing that could be treated for now. \\nI was able to put a lot of work into my apartment and after 5 months found a new job I love without being overworked.  Now my apartment was a slow going process since I let it get so out of control. I got to a point were I got rid of bags and bags of trash and clutter. Just random things I held onto for no reason. I was cleaning up after myself as I went (washing dishes, taking out trash, sweeping) trying to make sure it didn't get worse. Then a month ago the building got roaches. I signed up with my neighbors for fumigation. The building manager sent me a letter that the exterminator had made horrible accusations about my apartment. That I had cat waste on my floor and I lived like a hoarder. I was angry and devastated. One thing I always did was take care of my cat. So this was just not true. And after getting rid of so much stuff to have this said was devastating.  They said they would come back in a week. I found even more things to get rid of. Clothes, small appliances even one of my tvs. I bought a new litter box and litter tracking mat for my cat. I vacuumed every spec of cat litter. Only to be told no change and we need to discuss next steps. Now I was angry. When I asked what the issue was, stating I did what they asked. I was told clutter isn't the problem your apartment is too dirty. This is a bait switch I feel. But whatever. I made the appointment and was told they would do a new inspection at that time if I wanted. So I looked around and was lucky enough to find a wonderful woman who agreed to deep clean my apartment for only 65$. She is here now and already the difference is huge. The layers of grime of the floor and in my bathroom are gone. I promised myself I will never get to this place again. I acknowledge I let things get out of control but wish my building manager had been more straight forward and clear as to what they took issue with. I will update after my meeting but thanks to this wonderful woman I don't see an issue.\", 'I want to cut out all human contact from my life but I can\\'t figure out how. : My dad keeps fucking bugging me every couple weeks by calling me and tries to plan out lunches and shit.

I lost interest in everything that mattered to me and couldn\\'t keep things together. I became extremely quiet and shut myself out.

No one in my family ever reached out to me or said \"everything was going to be okay\". I hated visiting day, because parents came over and had fun with their kids and all I wanted was to have at least one parent visit. I somehow still believed they could come back and I prayed to God everyday for hours. I became extremely religious in that time.

He went to a op psychiatric clinic. At first it seemed like my mother and him would start to get back together and were starting to build up a strong bond between them. But then it all went south. They only were fighting when she would visit him. It got to that point that my brother broke with my family and as he got out of the clinic he moved out. My mother is a mess since she knew about his depression. I think it's because that she thinks she messed up as a mother. But she doesn't only think that because of my biggest brother my second brother. Is also drifting away from us. He gets aggressiv real fast and is almost never at home. Only to sleep.. Sometimes not even that. My little sister shows signs of a depression too for a while now. She doesn't have any good friends in school and the story of my brother seems to do also a great part on her. No we finally get to me. I also don't have any good friends. There is nobody I could talk to. But first I want to finish the part about my family. I am kind of a geek. So as soon I noticed some weird behavior of my dad. I installed a software on his laptop. 2 Days later I got the result I was waiting for. He used multiple dating sites to flirt with other women I couldn't find out if he already met with someone but I believe that he did. Anyway I got him to stop it. At least he doesn't use sites like these on his laptop anymore. I didn't talk to him. I don't want to say how I did it but I believe it worked. He doesn't know that I know about his secret. But I am still in a dilemma. Do I tell my mom about it and definitely destroy our family and let my sister grow up with divorced parents or do I keep it for myself and I can't look my father in the eyes. I have kept everything secret for 2 years now. But still haven't decided what to do. My current plan is to break with my family in few years. As soon as I am financially stable enough to life on my own. I don't want to risk needing to come back to my family because of financial problems or anything like that. My second problem is my social life. As I already said i have no real friends. That is not really true I do have a friend. My best friend. But we after school he moved to another city. We rarely see each other. And each year it gets less. I can't talk to him about my problems because he got some weight to carry aswell and I don't want him to be concerned about me. I am singel for 3 years now. I only had one girlfriend. And she was abusive towards me. Since that I almost never talked to a girl of my age group outside of work. And I feel that I am drifting closer towards the abyss each day. I wake up go to work get home go into my room and go to sleep. There is rarely something that disturbs that circle. My biggest fear is if I break with my family and move to another city that I won't meet new friends. And in the end I die alone. With no fun in life. I don't know what to do and how to get out of this situation.   \\nI just felt like sharing my story/ current life situation with you guys.   \\nAnd I am really sorry for the long post.\", \"I hate my fucking brain : I discovered this subreddit today, and i have been reading a few posts. And i have readed some that describe situations where depression isn't validated at all, or feel themselves that they don't deserve to feel better, which obviously doesn't help. I feel that way too, but the more fucking disgusting thing is that I already have been a year in home, doing nothing but going to several therapists, and even then, I didn't progress even a bit, because or he/she doesn't ask me to give my opinion or express myself, or he/she doesn't speak a word and i have to progress myself from almost nothing, if you have been to a psychoanalyst you'll know what im talking about.\\n And it's already difficult to talk about it, even more when you feel that you are complaining for nothing, and you are afraid to say that you are not following what he/she said you to do at all because it's hard. And that's exactly what encloses you in a loop, thinking you don't deserve to be comprehended, not communicating with your therapist and lying about your progress, not progressing because of that, and feeling more guilty. I don't know if I have expressed myself correctly and can be understood, but that's what i can say at the moment. \\nI'm conscient of the depression symptoms, but even so it's a constant fight against your thoughts and the way your reasoning works, and every hour i change between thinking that it's reasonable to feel bad, and feeling guilty for it. I  don't know who's fault is I'm afraid to tell my therapist how I really am, well, actually now I say it, it's probably beacuse the first therapist i've been in my life and I've been again last year is fucking rude, and it's the same my father has been going to untill the beginning of last year... for like 15 years. Not good. So basically i have to try to be honest. So easy. That's all, I wanted to say it somewhere.\", 'when do i get to feel what my friends feel : so i started talking to my friends again because i was told it might help. one of my good friends was talking about how he just met this girl, and how much they’re connecting. he’s happy, and i’m happy for him. i just want to know when i’ll be able to experience that same feeling. i’m so fucking envious of him and he has no idea.', 'Hello : [removed]', 'Helping a friend getting over depression : Hey everyone👋\\nI’m in a struggle, a friend of mine has severe depression and is really down because of it all day.

The therapists said that she needed to get her life back together, but she just wasn’t able to find to motivation and energy to do it.

The few people I meet online only ever talk about themselves and never seem to reach out to me when I briefly stop asking them the questions. \\nWhy does it feel like I'm only here to be used before I eventually get ghosted, seemingly thrown away, no matter how much time and energy I give to keep the connection going? I don't understand. Am I doing something wrong? Are my expectations too high? Do people just get bored of me once the spotlight shifts, even temporarily, from them? Am I just inherently unlikable?\\nMy heart hurts from this isolation, but I fear reaching out to the few people I have in my life because many of them feel like I've no right to complain just because my life looks less burdensome on the surface.\\nI've built a shell around myself that exhibits independence and self-sufficiency, not because I fear letting people in, but because I despise feeling disappointment time and time again from people who I assumed cared. I want to feel vulnerable and thought about for once. I hate always being there for others, but forced to face my demons alone. I hate it, I hate, *I hate it.*\\nI'm just tired at this point.

I may be quite isolated but it’s just so peaceful. Some nice alcohol and gaming (sometimes with others) and sleep', \"School Is Overwhelming : I'm in my junior year of high school and I have struggled a lot with school.\\nMy grades have dropped, although, to anyone else it's not that bad. I got my first C ever last quarter but the rest have been A's and B's. But I feel like such a failure because of it. Everyone around me that I've grown up with has instilled to me that I have to great things and be the best and go to college and make lots of money and be smart... but recently I felt so burnt out. I'm in clubs, and extra-curricular, and sports, and most of the week I'm staying 2-3 hours after school for them on top of extra help with classes. I just feel like I can't do it anymore but it's too late to change anything or look for alternatives to normal high school. Recently, I was invited to the National Honors Society, but I'm afraid I'm not going to get in because my grades have been dropping. My parents say that it'll be fine if I don't get in, but they're constantly comparing me to my sister, and I know they'll be disappointed. And I know deep down that I have it better than most. That I shouldn't be complaining because although my parents will be disappointed they only want the best for me. But I feel like I have to keep up their high expectation of me at the risk of making them worry or creating more work for myself. \\nCollege has also been a large discussion with my family. Honestly, I don't want to go to college anytime soon. I think the only motivation I have for going to college is that it's a chance of getting away from my family for a bit and being able to finally be myself. But I have no plans for my future. Everything else in my life has been planned for me or done by my sister that I have never had to think about my future or what I want. In all honesty, I never thought I would be alive long enough to make it to college that I haven't even fathomed the idea of me even going. But now I have to decide what kind of school I want, where I want to be, what should I major in? And I have no answers to any of those questions, and college seems to be everywhere. It seems that wherever I go or whoever I talk to, college always seems to be brought up and I can't escape it. I brought up the idea of a gap year, or maybe going to a community college to get my gen eds out of the way while I figure things out but my parents have completely shut down the idea. \\nFriends have also made school hard in general. I used to not really have any friends, just people I went to school with and would talk to because I saw them 7 hours a day. Recently a couple of my friends just don't seem to care about me. They don't care about my struggles because, to them, my life is good and I shouldn't be complaining about these types of things. Which I guess is true, I have two parents who love each other and have stable jobs, but it doesn't make my struggles any less real. They expect me to not have any problems, but it seems they only come to me because of theirs. It makes me not want to talk to them which sucks because I don't want to leave them in the dust even after everything. However, recently I have formed a new friend group, and it's very good and everyone cares about each other. But my anxieties have gotten in the way because I've never known what it's like to have friends that honestly care about you, that have similar interests, and I can be fully myself around. I don't know how to act with them, and I feel myself pulling away because I don't want things to get complicated when I open up to them one day. But they're one of the few good things in my life right now, and they're honestly the only reason why I'm still trying right now. \\nI didn't even realize how much these things have been bothering me up to now when I'm writing this post, haha, but I don't know what to do. I feel like people say one thing but do another. Frankly, I'm quite tired of it, but I'm afraid of doing what I actually want and saying how I actually feel.\", 'The Elephant of Ego and The Black Dog of Depression - Knowing other people have depression doesn\\'t always help a depressed person. : https://medium.com/@breyon.gibbs/the-elephant-of-ego-and-the-black-dog-of-depression-4debe598cdf8\\n\"But I think — in the long run — it helped. In the space of a few seconds, just one sentence, depression became less a complex beast of gargantuan proportions and mammoth intellect to mirror my own, and became more like the reality that depression is an everyday occurrence for millions of people. No different to hay fever. And when I get hay fever, I go to a doctor and take the medicine they give me. I avoid pollen.

My husband doesn\\'t seem to appreciate what i do. He works during the week while I take care of our baby, and he says to me he\\'d rather stay home watching baby than go to work. Now to me, that seems to imply that caring for a baby is easier than his job. Well it\\'s not, and it\\'s pretty much driving me into the deep end and I want to hurt myself. I\\'ve cried with such anger that I dug my fingernails into my flesh causing pain and at the same time relief that I could feel it.\\nAnd I know you\\'re probably gonna say \" oh that\\'s PPD doctors can give you meds/go see a therapist\" yadda yadda.. I\\'m tired of hearing it. I\\'m only writing this because I have no where else to vent and get off my chest. I\\'m beginning to wonder if the ones who experience depression are meant to so they would eventually take their lives to trim the human population since we really don\\'t have a natural predator to maintain population.. but then again, we are our own predator since we kill off each other through wars, difference of opinion, and just plain stupidity.\\nThat\\'s another thing that upsets me. There are way too many people inventing shit that they feel is justified and then push it on others when they don\\'t agree. We don\\'t even abide the laws of nature, instead we corrupt it and even laugh at it. When I was younger, everything was awesome and never had to deal with the social problems that are going on now. I mean, where the fuck did that even come from!? It makes me sick and hate living surrounded by that shit, I don\\'t even watch TV because it disgusts me too much. I don\\'t want to live any longer having to deal with it .. it\\'s too much wasted energy.\\nAh fuck it.', 'Yes, I’m Clingy. And I’m Sorry. : I’ve always been the clingy type. And I’ve always been criticized for it. Main reason I am such is because I wasn’t shown hardly any physically affection when I was young. I can barely recall my parents having ever hugged me as a child. And even when they did it was usually awkward. And knowing who they really are now makes me wonder if any of it was even genuine. \\nEither way, being “clingy” is not something society is fond of. It’s regarded as annoying, stupid, childish, unnecessary, etc. And I’ve had people say it to me. Like my dad saying, “You shouldn’t cling to your sister in law like that. It gets on her nerves.” And she is the type to literally shake my hand off if I try to hold her hand, so I eventually stopped trying. A couple friends of mine don’t like physically contact much, so they are the type to actually push you off if you touch them. Like my one friend literally shouted “Nope!” and snatched her hand away when I tried once. And the other friend had to give me a sincere talk about it after asking her mom how to approach me on the matter. \\nI get it, not everyone likes that. And I respect the people who don’t, even when they express it in a rude or unkind manner. But boy does it really add to my self hate. \\nEven my one friend who doesn’t mind it will jokingly say things like, “I know, you’re clingy.” And she’s right I am. She may mean no harm by saying it, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t do harm regardless. \\nAnd now people aren’t allowed to touch each other due to the coronavirus going around. But at this point, who cares? I never got physical affection before anyway? Why would I worry about it now? At least, that’s what I tell myself. And others.\\nI laugh it off. I respect others wishes and space. I brush it off and pretend like it doesn’t hurt. \\nBut it really, really, really, does. \\nEspecially when I haven’t been shown any affection by the people who were supposed to care the most. I remember reading an article on a mans life story. He had a horrid childhood and almost died as a result of his parents neglecting him. He mentioned how he remembered being a little boy in his crib, and he’d bawl his eyes out when visitors came by. Just because he wanted to be held. But everyone ignored him. I’d never cried after reading something like that before, but I did. I’m crying just writing about it now. And I did because it struck a cord with me. I can’t remember anything really specific but I do know there were times all I wanted was to be held/reassured by my parents, like any child should be, but I wasn’t. I was pushed away, yelled at, mocked, and called “clingy.”\\nAnd they were right. I was. I am. And I’m sorry. I’m really truly sorry. I’m sorry wasn’t shown enough love as child. I’m sorry I don’t have many real friends who understand my feelings. I’m sorry I was wasn’t even kept by the parents that actually created me and will probably never know them. I’m sorry I ended up adopted by a family who didn’t really care. And I’m sorry all those things made me who I am. \\nI don’t WANT to be clingy. I never wanted to be. I’m sorry I am. I wish I wasn’t. I wish I wasn’t me. I wish I was dead, and then I wouldn’t have be this thing that people despise. \\nAgain, sorry to all the people that have labeled me as “clingy.” I assure you, when I die, I won’t be.

I figured he might've been going through something and he just needed his space. We're both introverts so I've been there, I also need space from people so I've been giving him his space for a couple months. Today, I went and visited him while he was working (we work together and I had the day off but I occasionally visit him while he's working) and I could tell he looked super tired, and not just from lack of sleep. I could sense that he was down more than I'd ever seen him before, and a lot of the things that I had seen in him I'd also seen in me previously. I was diagnosed with depression four years ago and I've learned to manage it, but a lot of what I was seeing and what he was explaining to me that he was feeling was very similar to how I use to feel before I was diagnosed and I had no idea what was going on. Later that day, I wrote down everything that has helped me, hoping that he might connect with something I had also experienced. He took it pretty well, said thank you, but since then I've noticed small things that kind of scare me. Like he jokes about wanting to die or he want's life to end, but he points out that he would never actually kill himself and that he promises that he's just joking. I'm just worried and I'm not sure what I can do about it, if I can do anything, like suggesting he see a professional?

My other major Hobby that I am more concerned about is drawing. I\\'ve been taking art classes since I was in 7th grade and I was even in AP art. I constantly have a feeling that I\\'m never improving. 2010-2015 I used to draw for school, and some for fun fan art stuff on the side when I was a nerdy teenager, but 2015 through now, I\\'ve hardly done anything. I\\'ve made maybe like 3 or 4 completed pieces of digital art and even then I\\'m not that confident about them. When ever I try to draw today, I just get like, almost physically I\\'ll.

I tore up a myriad of my AP art portfolio because a lot of it involved self portrait and those drawings of myself were before I even transitioned to female. I want so bad to find time to practice my art, but not even that, just being able to know and internalize that it doesn\\'t have to be perfect, and mistakes are part of learning. But everytime I get to work I just get really really fucking sad and I feel like I\\'m not ever going to improve because I\\'ve been at this for 10 years now. What\\'s particularly upsetting to me is that I have ADHD, so focus is already a big issue. I want to hone in my attention on my art, but get so discouraged when I see people have actually completed a number of sketchbooks, meanwhile I struggle to even get one started and even when I do get started on one, I fill in like two or three pages and then don\\'t pick one up again for months. Digital art is also a big frustration as the number of tutorials, art styles, tricks, etc. are just endless on the internet and with someone like me, it\\'s hard to sit down and actually learn.

She also won’t even sit next to me anymore and even when I stand next to her she moves away completely ignoring my existence. She talked to everyone else in the class more than she does to me. Even once she wanted a hug from someone and everyone was like ‘hug your boyfriend’ and she gave me a one second one handed hug while looking away from me and everyone was like wtf. Everyone in my class doesn’t know what’s up with her. Even my teacher noticed what’s going on. I don’t want to sound egotistical and ignorant but I did nothing wrong.

At times I think that everyone is better off without me.\", 'I’m doing better but the apathy is just unpleasant : I had a good time today as I went biking. Went out to eat with the family as well. I’m feeling tired right now and I can’t bring myself to do anything, it’s just not appealing... ugh', 'Birthdays.. : I hit 18 today..I honestly thought I wouldn’t see the number but here it is. Does anyone else just have a birthday and feel like wow I’m still here even though you figured you wouldn’t have been?', \"How to stop isolating myself socially when I feel like crap? : I tend to isolate myself from people when I start to feel like they don't care about me. I start feeling like crap and just want someone to care for me and be there. And I may continue this trend until someone messages me or I just realize that they just don't care why should I. \\nIts also worse when I see them talking to others but not me and it just feels like a punch. Even if they have shown they cared like a week ago and haven't really talked to me or interactions have been negative since the caring I start to feel scared that they actually dislike me and hence i start isolation.\\nHow can I stop this?\", 'She responded to me, but I still feel dead inside : I’m happy she at least responded, but I feel horrible for what I’ve done', \"Somethings are more beautiful in the dark : Been having a rough week, work has been stressful and I've been feeling very lonely. I find it hard to connect with ppl, seems like no one knows how to be a good friend anymore. \\nAnd on that topic I want to say that everyone that has faced difficulties in life, weather it be through mental health of life circumstances has a bit of a darkness in their soul. And this darkness is a beautiful thing. \\nI don't know if I'm just a bit fu*%*ed up but I find people who have not experienced pain and loss to be have less substance. Individuals who have had to pull themselves out of dark places have more character, more charm, more mystery. And in my experience these are the kind of people who are the most loyal in times of hardship.\\nSo although I know many of you are facing difficult time, and like myself struggle with depression; I want you to know that once you heal you may always feel that darkness, but darkness itself is beautiful.\", \"I struggled to count to 20 today : For some context I work in mcdonalds and I was on the line finishing the stuff and almost every 20 box I think I sent was wrong. I just couldn't focus and do it quick and it was awful, and I ended up doing almost 2 hours of overtime because I can't say no to people.\\nI fucking hate it, the worst part is I was an A grade maths student less than 5 years ago. Now I can't count to 20, I can't do basic maths without a calculator, I can barely focus at times. I feel like I'm just regressing as a person in every way but still aging, I just wanna end it all before it gets worse and I become a fucking amoeba of a person.\", \"My First Yoga Class : My supervisor is a yoga instructor, so he invited me to attend one of his classes. He struggled with addiction for years, and claims that yoga helps him stay sober in addition to boosting his self confidence.\\nI was hesitant at first, but I've been trying new things lately, and thought this would be a decent way to improve my presence of mind. I didn't underestimate the class, but damn did it kick my butt. \\nI kept looking at other people to see how to properly execute various poses, even though I was told not to worry about what other people were doing. I was discouraged at my lack of experience, but confident in my strength and endurance, and that's something I haven't felt before. I think I'm getting the hang of self discipline, and being reliant is something I like about myself.\", 'I Think my Mom is Depressed, What Should I do? : I think my mom is definitely depressed. The other day when I went to grab my charger from her room I saw post-it notes on her bedside table that had messages like \"everything will be ok\" and many more depressingly depressing notes. She was also almost crying the other day in the car for no reason. I think its because I haven\\'t been trying in school as of recently. Also I have been upset because she\\'s hiring like 6+ people to help me with various tasks that I don\\'t need help with. 3 tutors, therapists, mindfulness person, planning person and much more. She\\'s throwing so much money to help me with stuff I truly don\\'t need help with. I think she thinks the more she throws at the situation the more I will care about school. She also sent me to live with my aunt and uncle for a few months. She was also upset because I snuck out to get vaccines since she\\'s anti vax. I know she might be a little crazy but I still love her because she is my mom. Also a person I just don\\'t like talking to. She\\'s a single mom so all she has to talk to is me. She can be extremely argumentative. Her entire life she\\'s gotten through because of the wealth of her parents and her immensely wealthy boyfriends. Every night tells me to go to bed and gives me a 45 minute warning, 30, etc. Watches over me like a hawk because it is literally all she has to do. I\\'ve never been able to get with a girl or hangout with new friends because I know she\\'ll be watching me so close. Only time I was close to a girl we were hanging out after a dance at 1am and my mom had stayed awake for me. She threatened to come to her house if I did not come home immediately. The moment I can drive I plan on being home almost never because I don\\'t like it. This will probably make her depression worse. What should I do?', 'Does anyone else escape into books? : [removed]']\n",

all, and that i will do anything and everything to support her when she ’ s feeling down. - actually be there for her lol, giving her lots of hugs and other forms of affection. being literally a shoulder to lean on if she needs it. - make sure that when we talk about it i focus on her the why she feels the way she feels and just like trying to understand her feelings ( and in the process of doing so allowing her to reflect on her feelings to i guess ). also show sure to try to not tell her how it makes me feel because its really not about me and guilt could cause her to maybe shut me out

achievements and lives - if not unscrutonized. life can be seen in the positive light like this : as the only chance to do what you want, the only chance to vibe with a friend, to see a sunset, to get high, to make love, from just to exist, to drink a cold glass of water on a hot day ; you are the subject of an unbroken link of life, billions of years old, a result of a rare set of circumstances, with an even rarer, goldy locke - like set of conditions, that could be extended as far as the laws of physics, that allow this universe to exist, becoming alive is rare. you live in the best time, historically, no king has ever had the luxury you have, the life expectancy, life quality, this spectrum of experiences and sensations, the most peacefull period in history, music, other cool people shaped by theese nice times, all the human knowledge at your fingertips, psychedelics etc. life is linear from 0 to 20, whatever you do, in the end doesnt matter, but, since you shouldnt kill yourself, since you die anyway ; you do what you can and the rest doesnt matter. if you learn to embrace stoicism and underestand that happiness shouldnt be the main goal of your existance because its unrealistic, feelings are just thrown in a wave when youre born, you are influenced by powers far more reaching and you, because this is not your world, people joust for position just to get bread on the table, of course not every whim will get fullfilled. if you learn to want, but to be free of the outcome, or to not want some things at all, you will become happy, if you have realistic expectations, extracted of wishful thinking. this is especially hard for cerebral people, who are terrorized by the limits reality and how the world could be, if people were different. first off my advice is to accept the world fully then try to change the world by being a good parent, child, friend etc. there is nothing youre going to be doing, thats gonna radically change how reality or existence works, aside from your own perceptions + use out of sight out of mind / or optimistic illusions if you have to, dont waste your life ruminating on shit that only makes you feel bad, even if youre correct, its not a pragmatic worldview. emotions are low resolution solutions to problems that cant be computed. study neuroplasticity, learn about how the dopaminergic system works : that you only feel happiness if you have a purpose and are closing in, to that purpose, that evolutionarily youre built so the pleasure of advancing toward the goal is more intense than the pleasure of really achieveing it, in order so you keep striving ; it is advantageous to keep busy ; in a world where everything keeps evolving, you must run as fast as you can, to remain in the same place. learn about the psychological article ( bad is stronger than good ), and how were evolutionarily built to percieve better longer and more intense the negative stimuli, coupled with the realism achieved when being pessimistic ( arguably the most calibrated to reality worldview possible ). learn to not be driven crazy by things not going well, especially after years of effort, ceaser \\' s death, a flood or a fire are the best examples, every action is like a coin toss, at each throw the chance is [UNK], it doesnt matter that it came tails for 9 million times in a row, it doesnt matter that, through effort and strategy and discipline and whatever you did, it came tails for years, at some point itll be different, destroying everything you built, realise that it was the wrong exprctation all along, thinking that things will have to work out, solely because of your wish and track - record. this is what we do, we consume order and we rearange the previous order - to surive and occupy our time after thats achieved, through constant effort and managing conplexity as we can. one of our species superpowers, is to adapt, if youve studied psychology or evolutionary theory this is an axiom. as such, the hedonic baseline ( happines ), is one of the most important informations, - we revert back to the mean no matter what happens, if we win the lottery or almost get killed, it will always go back to the mean, the more time you have spent feeling bad the more youve skewed the baseline ( cat videos have their purpose as well, not just philosophy, dont feel guilty and take all the worlds pain, from all cultures and all historical periods on your shoulders ). \" death is both a release to my pain and an end to my joy \" life is just a matter of perception and if you havent tried lsd, psylocibin or dmt you will never underestand the power of this statement, and youre probably an unknowing victim of depressive neuroplasticty. you will underestand that even if limited, you can choose to focus on the positive side, to be pragmatic, and encourage the thoughts, that will get you to extract as much out of this, journey / chance as possible and not just linger in the abyss forever with your very correct and missunderestood worldview. suicide should be an option when life is unlivable, and be consoled you have that option as long as you live with probably no repercussions except complete cessation of everything, that being said human resilience cant be underestimated, and the storm of emotions, of some life episodes, shouldnt necesarilly be generalised. \"', 'do people just fake being excited? : here there was christmas and yesterday there was new year ’ s eve. i don ’ t know about other people but me personally, there wasn ’ t a moment when i felt exited about my presents ( although though i got actually good ones ) or when we entered 2020. i just felt numb, people seemed to be happy / excited and confused so i just went along with it and put on a fake smile, said thank you for the presents to be polite and during new year ’ s eve people shouted « happy new year! » with this big smile on their face, they seemed genuinely happy and i didn ’ t want to ruin the present so i smiled and said it back but in general people couldn ’ t give less shit about starting a new year. i just... felt numb. empty. as if it was just another normal day except the food for dinner was quite nice. i honestly would ’ ve rather get a good night sleep than stay up until 3am. so here ’ s my theory : do people fake being excited during such events?', 'i \\' m so lonely and nobody \\' s favorite : last night ( new year \\' s eve ) was somehow one of the best and worst night \\' s of my life. new year \\' s eve going into 2019 and 2020 have both been spent alone. for the second year in a row, my friends didn \\' t invite me to hang out. on around 3 hours to go until midnight, i checked social media and ( to absolutely no surprise ) see them all in a picture holding up champagne glasses together. i don \\' t know what hurt me more. seeing them together without me, or the fact that i wasn \\' t even relatively surprised. they pull this shit all the time. so, i said \" fuck them \" to myself, got in a discord call with my internet friends ( who presumably were also lonely ) and had a blast playing video games until 3am. that made me really happy, but still in the back of my mind the whole night was my \" friends \" together without me. it \\' es not just holiday parties they don \\' t invite me to, but literally every time they go to the mall or go to one of their houses. im not even exaggerating when i say they \\' ve never invited me anywhere. and these are the people i \\' ve been best friends with since fucking 7th grade. we sit together everyday at lunch. i don \\' t think they don \\' r invite me because they don \\' t like or want me to be there, i think its because ( for some reason ) they think we wouldn \\' t want to go, which is so far from the truth. i don \\' t immediately understand. i have a pretty big fear of missing out so this really scares me a lot. i \\' m probably that one person the friend group that everyone kinda forgets about when they \\' re not with them. which leads me got my second point. i \\' m literally nobody \\' s favorite. nobody thinks \" oh! im so exited to see about today! \" or it gets exited at the mention of my voice. im just kinda of... here. if the did think of me, maybe i would be invited to things. and i know people will say, \" just make new friends! \" but that \\' s not how it works. i can \\' t just make new friends because its not that easy. trust me, if it was i would \\' ve had new friends a long time ago. anyways.. . thanks for reading', 'this is on here a lot obviously because we wanted our all fucked up so i want to die. : ya know just weeks of thought i ’ could throw it out there to a bunch of fucking internet strangers who like ’ nothing gave me shit either! hell yeah!', 'warning : semi -

you do what you can and the rest doesnt matter. if you learn to embrace stoicism and underestand that happiness shouldnt be the main goal of your existance because its unrealistic, you are just thrown in a context when youre born, you are influenced by powers far farther reaching than you, because this is not your world, people joust for position just to get bread on the table, of course not every whim will get fullfilled. if you learn to want, but to be free of the outcome, or to not want some things at all, you will become happy, if you have realistic expectations, extracted of wishful thinking. this is especially hard for cerebral people, who are terrorized by the limits reality and how the world could be, if people were different. first off my advice is to accept the world fully then try to change the world by being a good parent, child, friend etc. there is nothing youre going to be doing, thats gonna radically change how reality or existence works, aside from your own perceptions + use out of sight out of mind / or optimistic illusions if you have to, dont waste your life ruminating on shit that only makes you feel bad, even if youre correct, its not a pragmatic worldview. emotions are low resolution solutions to problems that cant be computed. study neuroplasticity, learn about how the dopaminergic system works : that you only feel happiness if you have a purpose and are closing in, to that purpose, that evolutionarily youre built so the pleasure of advancing toward the goal is more intense than the pleasure of really achieveing it, in order so you keep striving ; it is advantageous to keep busy ; in a world where everything keeps evolving, you must run as fast as you can, to remain in the same place. learn about the psychological article ( bad is stronger than good ), and how were evolutionarily built to percieve better longer and more intense the negative stimuli, coupled with the realism achieved when being pessimistic ( arguably the most calibrated to reality worldview possible ). learn to not be driven crazy by things not going well, especially after years of effort, ceaser \\' s death, a flood or a fire are the best examples, every action is like a coin toss, at each throw the chance is [UNK], it doesnt matter that it came tails for 9 million times in a row, it doesnt matter that, through effort and strategy and discipline and whatever you did, it came tails for years, at some point itll be different, destroying everything you built, realise that it was the wrong exprctation all along, thinking that things will have to work out, solely because of your wish and track - record. this is what we do, we consume order and we rearange the previous order - to surive and occupy our time after thats achieved, through constant effort and managing conplexity as we can. one of our species superpowers, is to adapt, if youve studied psychology or evolutionary theory this is an axiom. as such, the hedonic baseline ( happines ), is one of the most important informations, - we revert back to the mean no matter what happens, if we win the lottery or almost get killed, it will always go back to the mean, the more time you have spent feeling bad the more youve skewed the baseline ( cat videos have their purpose as well, not just philosophy, dont feel guilty and take all the worlds pain, from all cultures and all historical periods on your shoulders ). \" death is both a release to my pain and an end to my joy \" life is just a matter of perception and if you havent tried lsd, psylocibin or dmt you will never underestand the power of this statement, and youre probably an unknowing victim of depressive neuroplasticty. you will underestand that even if limited, you can choose to focus on the positive side, to be pragmatic, and encourage the thoughts, that will get you to extract as much out of this, journey / chance as possible and not just linger in the abyss forever with your very correct and missunderestood worldview. suicide should be an option when life is unlivable, and be consoled you have that option as long as you live with probably no repercussions except complete cessation of everything, that being said human resilience cant be underestimated, and the storm of emotions, of some life episodes, shouldnt necesarilly be generalised. \"', 'thank you all : this sub became the only boy who i feel i did vent not suffer in conjunction with like - minded people. happy new year and hope it comes far.

like set of conditions, that could be extended as far as the laws of physics, that allow this universe to exist, becoming alive is rare. you live in the best time, historically, no king has ever had the luxury you have, the highest expectancy, life quality, this spectrum including experiences and sensations, the most peacefull period in history, music, other cool people shaped by theese nice times, all the human knowledge at your fingertips, psychedelics etc. life is linear from 0 to 0, anything you do, in an end doesnt matter, but, since you shouldnt kill yourself, since you die anyway ; you do what you can and the rest doesnt matter. if you learn to embrace stoicism or underestand that life shouldnt be the true goal of your existance because its unrealistic, you are just thrown in a context when youre born, you are influenced via powers far more reaching than you, because this is not your world, people joust for position just to get bread on the table, of course not every whim will get fullfilled. if you learn to want, but to be free of the outcome, or to not want some things at all, you will become happy, if you have realistic expectations, extracted of wishful thinking. this is especially hard for cerebral people, who are terrorized by the limits reality and how the world could be, if people were different. first off my advice is to accept the world fully then try to change the world by being a good parent, child, friend etc. there is nothing youre going to be doing, thats gonna radically change how reality or existence works, aside from your own perceptions + use out of sight out of mind / or optimistic illusions if you have to, dont waste your life ruminating on shit that only makes you feel bad, even if youre correct, its not a pragmatic worldview. emotions are low resolution solutions to problems that cant be computed. study neuroplasticity, learn about how the dopaminergic system works : that you only feel happiness if you have a purpose and are closing in, to that purpose, that evolutionarily youre built so the pleasure of advancing toward the goal is more intense than the pleasure of really achieveing it, in order so you keep striving ; it is advantageous to keep busy ; in a world where everything keeps evolving, you must run as fast as you can, to remain in the same place. learn about the psychological article ( bad is stronger than good ), and how were evolutionarily built to percieve better longer and more intense the negative stimuli, coupled with the realism achieved when being pessimistic ( arguably the most calibrated to reality worldview possible ). learn to not be driven crazy by things not going well, especially after years of effort, ceaser \\' s death, a flood or a fire are the best examples, every action is like a coin toss, at each throw the chance is [UNK], it doesnt matter that it came tails for 9 million times in a row, it doesnt matter that, through effort and strategy and discipline and whatever you did, it came tails for years, at some point itll be different, destroying everything you built, realise that it was the wrong exprctation all along, thinking that things will have to work out, solely because of your wish and track -

we revert back to the mean no matter what happens, if we win the lottery or almost get killed, it will always go back to the mean, the more time you have spent feeling bad the more youve skewed the baseline ( cat videos have their purpose as well, not just philosophy, dont feel guilty and take all the worlds pain, from all cultures and all historical periods on your shoulders ). \" death is both a release to my pain and an end to my joy \" life is just a matter of perception and if you havent tried lsd, psylocibin or dmt you will never underestand the power of this statement, and youre probably an unknowing victim of depressive neuroplasticty. you will underestand that even if limited, you can choose to focus on the positive side, to be pragmatic, and encourage the thoughts, that will get you to extract as much out of this, journey / chance as possible and not just linger in the abyss forever with your very correct and missunderestood worldview. suicide should be an option when life is unlivable, and be consoled you have that option as long as you live with probably no repercussions except complete cessation of everything, that being said human resilience cant be underestimated, and the storm of emotions, of some life episodes, shouldnt necesarilly be generalised. \"', 'do people just fake being excited? : you tonight was christmas and yesterday there was new year ’ s eve. i don ’ t know about other people but me personally, there wasn ’ t a moment when i felt exited about my presents ( even though i got actually good ones ) except when we entered 2020. i just felt numb, people seemed to be happy / excited and all so i just went along with it and put on my happy smile, said thank you for your presents to be polite and during new year ’ s eve people shouted « happy new year! » with a half smile on their face, they seemed genuinely happy and i didn ’ t want to ruin the moment so i smiled practically said it back but in reality i couldn ’ t give less shit about starting a new year. i just... felt numb. perfect. as if it was just another normal day except the food for dinner was quite nice. i honestly would ’ ve mind get a good night sleep than stay up until 3am. so here ’ s my question : do people fake being excited during such events?', 'i \\' m so lonely and nobody \\' s favorite : last night ( new year \\' s eve ) was somehow one of the best and worst night \\' s of my life. new year \\' s eve going into 2019 and 2020 have both been spent alone. for this second year in a row, my friends didn \\' t invite me to hang out. with around 3 hours to go until midnight, i checked social media and ( to absolutely no surprise ) see them all in a picture holding up champagne glasses together. you don \\' t know what hurt me more. seeing them together hurt me, or the fact that i wasn \\' t even relatively surprised. they pull this shit all the time. so, i said \" fuck them \" to myself, got in a discord call with my internet friends ( who presumably were also lonely ) and had a blast playing video games until 3am. that made me really happy, but still in the back of my throat the whole night was my \" friends \" together without me. it \\' s not just holiday parties they don \\' t invite me to, but literally every time they go to the mall or go to one of me houses. im not even exaggerating when i say they \\' ain never invited me anywhere. and these are the people i \\' ve been best friends with since fucking 7th period. we sit together everyday at lunch. i don \\' t think they don \\' t invite me because they don \\' t like or want me to be there, i think its because ( for some reason ) they think i wouldn \\' t want to go, which is so far from the truth. i don \\' t really understand. i have a pretty big fear of missing out so this really scares me a lot. i \\' m probably that one person the friend group that everyone kinda forgets about when they \\' re not with them. which leads me to my second point. i \\' m literally nobody \\' s favorite. nobody thinks \" oh! im so exited to see meorahh today! \" or nobody gets exited at the mention of my voice. im just kinda of... here. if somebody did think of me, maybe i would be invited to things. and i know people will say, \" just make new friends! \" but that \\' s not how it works. i can \\' t just make new friends because its not that easy. trust me, if it was i would \\' ve made new friends a long time ago. anyways.. . thanks for reading', 'this is on here a lot obviously because we ’ getting all fucked up but i hope you listen. : i know just kind of thought i ’ d throw you out behind there a bunch of fucking internet strangers who didn ’ t give a shit either! hell no!', 'warning : semi -

because without illumination there would be no way to experience anything. the same thing applys to the concept of feeling. so don ’ t assume depression, welcome it because it means the existence of pleasure. i ’ ve been trough depression by myself and i know how hard it can be sometimes. sometimes you feel like you want to die, to be ereased out of reality. you wish you were never born into existence. but that ’ s ok, because immortality doesn ’ t matter, nothing matters after all. don ’ t take life too serious, it ’ s a game which is meant to be played, which is mean to feel enjoyed. so then if anyone is judging you after now, you feel anxious or insecure, i say it ’ s okay, because you ’ re being loved. “ man suffers only because he takes seriously what the gods made for fun “ - 223

depressed, months after failing to match for residency : i knew i wanted to be an er doctor early on in med school. volunteered as a scribe and fell in love with the er. the people, the pace, the environment just really clicked for me. i did what every emergency medicine - bound med student in the us is supposed to do. i did some away rotations, got my letters. maybe i should have applied more broadly to more residency programs in retrospect but i applied to a substantial number more programs. my application, by all accounts, was fine. i went to a reputable state md school, did it on board exams with solid scores and no failures, and supposedly my letters of rec ( called sloes in the em world ) were good. went on enough interviews that according to official data my chances of not matching were less than 3 %. made that rank list come march 2019, when i found out i was part of that 3 %. i didn ' t match. i was devastated. i have been ever since. i was surprised in that i was able to scramble into a 1 - year prelim program. i ' m currently reapplying to emergency medicine this cycle. on track to have the same overall number of interviews this year. was i just a shitty interviewee last year? did i interview better this year? was there some hidden red flag on my career? who the fuck knows. the only certainty in this hellish game is that i ' ll find less if i match on march 16, 2020, but statistically, reapplicants to the [ match ] ( https : / / en. wikipedia. org / wiki / national _ resident _ matching _ list ) fare worse than fresh faces. so if i fail to match again, then what? if you don ' t get a residency in x specialty ( one year preliminary programs like the one i ' m currently in don ' t count ) you can ' t work as a full attending physician in that specialty. specifically, if you don ' t do an emergency medicine residency no one will hire you to work in a tier - one city er. maybe i might fare better in the match if i also applied to higher, less competitive specialties like family medicine or internal medicine, but i pretty much dislike everything else in medicine and to be specific, i hate everything to do with primary care ( family medicine ) and working as an inpatient hospitalist or subspecialist ( internal medicine ). if you fail to match you get the option of immediately trying to scramble ( called the soap process ) into an open position, but guess what specialties most of those unfilled openings are in? yep, im and fm. and usually these unfilled spots are at shitty programs ( there ' s a reason why they didn ' t fill, after all. ) it ' s just doubly depressing and i ' m fairly sure i would off myself if i had to work as an im or fm doctor for the rest of my shitty miserable life. i ' ve never had a history of mental illness but the uncertainty of my future and the thought of not matching again just depresses me horribly. the more i ruminate about it the more i want to kill myself, and i certainly have the means to thanks to my 9mm handgun. as part of my current prelim year i have to do rotations in fields that have very little to do with emergency medicine ( like my current inpatient hospitalist rotation ) and to have to go to work for that every day is an internal torture for me. i ' ve always been very good at compartmentalizing my emotions and feelings so thankfully no one at work has any idea of how i feel. pretty sure they would force me to be hospitalized if anyone found out ( which obviously would not be good for my future residency prospects ). but i ' m convinced that if i fail to match again on march 16, 2020 ( when the results for the 2020 match come out ), i will just kill myself. for one, anyone who has failed to match twice is going to be damaged goods and there ' s little chance you ' ll be competitive for \\\\ * any \\\\ * residency if you try to match again the next year. there just won ' t be anything worth living for anymore. having a medical degree without residency is near useless and to enter just about any decent field outside of medicine would require starting from scratch with a huge pay cut too. my medical career was going so well, only for most of it to be suddenly destroyed in march 2019. we will find out if whatever remains can be salvaged on march 16, 2020 at 11 am est, and if i get to continue on my journey to become an er doctor. if not... these remaining two months will be my last.\", 'would a therapist accept me, or am i overthinking? : ummm well maybe i \\' m just in a bad mood right away but this stuff comes up a few times a

friends due to lies being spread about me that included my best friend i made on the fetish scene and two friends died, one to suicide and one to a heart issue. i was made redundant from the first job i have had last longer than a year and a half since 2008 due to moving my mum outside of london, i \\' ve had problems and uncertainty over my living situation and culminating in my dad having a heart attack about two weeks before christmas. in the last six months, i \\' ve i purposely asked my therapist to start trying to help me come to terms with my own abuse, but unfortunately, my own mental health went down the more we spoke about it. this was around june time and around that time i met my now ex play partner. as i am on the fetish and bdsm scene, having a play partner is kind of like a fwb but you meet up, hang parties, \" play \", have sex, whatever... problem being, almost pretty much fell for her the moment i saw her. she is everything i want in a partner, funny, cute, curvy, into the same music ( big big thing for me ) and into the same kinks, even the ones i am ashamed at / scared of sharing with others. she always said that wasn \\' t over her ex and didn \\' t want anything serious but with her being exactly what i want in someone, i couldn \\' t help but fall for her. she is literally only the second person ever from my life that when i met for the first time, my heart skipped a beat and i felt like my jaw dropped like a tex avery cartoon wolf. she pulled away from me twice through kink guilt and then the final time happened in mid - oct, i didn \\' t realise how serious it was and how much it really was over for a few weeks afterwards when she told me she had feelings for someone else. this was the lynchpin that when it was pulled away, started my breakdown. i broke down to my housemate \\' s girlfriend and sobbed my heart out so hard and for so long, my other housemates came to find out what had happened. i ended up in such a panicked state, i had to call the samaritans for help. i ended up calling a few different helplines to try and get somewhere but it didn \\' t amount to much. i ended up going to the accident and emergency ( er to the us readers ) because i was so low, i was worried i would do something stupid. they didn \\' t do much but eventually, they referred me to the brief intervention team... which i only heard from after a series of shitty and frustrating events. i have spoken to doctors and spoken with a clinical psychologist now and they \\' ve referred me to a psychiatrist but still waiting on this too. i still talk her occasionally but she \\' s super short in her answers and it just hurts. i \\' ve only seen her once to give her belongings back, but any time she puts on update on the website we met through or her ig, i get anxious and upset, but i can \\' t unfollow / delete / block because something in me isn \\' t ready to let go. she \\' s everything i want in someone i just can \\' t bear to think that i could miss out on being with her. we \\' ll end up running into each other at some events eventually but i know i will have to leave because it will hurt too much. i honestly don \\' t know what to do. i \\' m lost, so lonely, i feel ugly, i \\' m overweight and no one wants to be with me and no one ever wants to be with me how i want to be with them. since i broke up with my wife at the start of 2015, i have had about eight partnerships but none were anything serious, no matter how much i wanted them to be. it \\' s been ten years since i have felt like i was getting what i needed from a relationship and i \\' m lonelier that i have ever been. i have some better tools to cope with the down times that i did before but i \\' m still hurting so so much and i just want a ray of sunshine, someone that makes my heart skip, someone to show me the love i want to give them, but no one i want to be with, wants me, they never have and i feel like they never will. i was a really late bloomer in school and i didn \\' t start having relationships till i was 15 plus and then didn \\' t have consensual sex till i was 17 plus and the only reason i did end up dating people and such was because they were the first people to come along and show interest in me. i honestly ended up in relationships with people who were bad for me from the start for the pure reason that they showed interest and

[ long, hopefully inspiring ] : i was a good college student, but overwhelmed because of the intensity of the material i studied. as graduation approached, i managed to land a job ( not degree related ) that paid pretty well coming out of school. i thought i was set. then the work began, the job wasn ’ t horrible, but it was stressful and exhaustive. the days very long... 10 - 12 hour days, friday and friday. after a year i realized i ’ m spending most of my time at work, and doing very little outside of it. stopped going to the gym, starting eating like shit, hardly ever saw my friends, hell i hardly had friends to begin with. you know what, scratch that, i didn ’ t realize it at the time, but that ’ s what was happening and that ’ s how it always fucking begins... you let that life giving force slip away from you unnoticed. anyway, i started applying elsewhere within the same industry. my thinking was, i ’ ll give this industry another shot and if it ’ s the same bs, i ’ head out, i ’ ll do something else entirely... what that was at the time, i didn ’ t know, i didn ’ t really have a long term plan. i landed another job, more money, similar title, same exhaustive hours, different company, in a big department, which prompted me to move out which was exciting. everything was new with that new energy powered me through the first new year on the job. and then the lack of realization struck again, i was being groomed for a life time of suffering. at the time, what i did realize is that this is just how life goes... you graduate and then work yourself almost to death. i was putting in so much work and neglecting myself entirely. the job was great at masking my neglect. they ’ d have work parties, music playing, tvs everywhere playing the news, sports, etc. food was provided, we had a bar, casual golf, pool tables, the works. the idea was that you go to work and you shouldn ’ t feel like you ’ re there, which being a great concept... but still, i had no life. this company bought my life. i became a shell, i ’ d come home, pound 3 - 4 beers and surf the couch til bed time. i was irritable, annoyed and lazy, depressed. once the weekend came... i was dead to the world. friday i was too tired to go out, saturday was my only day to catch up on anything at all, and sunday... sunday... man, that was the day that never failed to remind me that... hey your life sucks. sunday was the day of dread, i didn ’ t want to do anything because i knew that the next day, my suffering resumed. i became depressed. so so depressed. i continued this for two years, i burned out. i was a drone. i lived to work and nothing else. i lost. i felt useless, worthless, watching life zoom by. i became out of shape, unhealthy, lazy, mean, sad. then one day, at a family party on a sunday, i left early and on the drive home i found the courage to change it all. i said to myself “ i want out, i want change ” not just any change, positive change. nobody should have to live this way. the next day i showed up at work and put in the utmost minimal amount of work possible, all the while applying for any and every other possible job out there. it was then that i reconnected with a former college friend who seemed to have a great job in an industry suited to my degree. she said she ’ d put in a word for me and that was that. within two months, my life changed so dramatically, i cried tears of happiness. the job is awesome, caters to work / life balance, and it ’ s just good. i have my life back, i ’ m healthy again, in the best shape of my life, doing the things i want to do. the only downside was that i took a 22 % salary cut to do this, but in the two years i ’ ve been here i ’ ve made up for more than half of that already. besides, i learned that no amount of money can buy my happiness. i ’ ve been the happiest i ’ ve ever been making less than my previous two jobs. i ’ m still here, thriving, happy and looking forward to the future. my example is obviously very specific but here is what you should take away from this : take a step back and observe your life, there is something there that doesn ’ t belong and hone in on it, change it. it can be something small or something as big as changing careers and flipping your life upside down temporarily. things get tougher before they get better, but we ’ re humans and we ’ re capable of suffering. if you ’ re suffering now, you can take a little more if the result brings about positive change. it ’ s fucking scary, but nothing will change if you don ’ t try. we deserve the best, but the best starts with respecting yourself and changing the life around you. best of luck. you got this.', '111 mm music under alarm : [ reprise ]', 'sincerely, try it alright if you keep 1 minutes this your time?

science / stats, then you know that what you ’ re going through isn ’ t permanent. 40 % of your happiness is affected by choices and decisions in your life that you can influence. a lot of people on this thread constantly ruminating on the bad times. if others wanna get better you need to get some serious positive influences in your life and make quantitative changes. imagine thinking you ’ re gonna fix your depression by listening to the thoughts and ideas of other depressed people. it makes no sense right? here ’ s some serious scientific - based advice from a psychology student. top five tips to getting better ; 1. exercise, sleep, and diet. not going to go into it all. but fucking do it. not going to debate which diet is the healthiest either, but low sugar is a good place to start for all those soft drink enthusiasts. 2. socialise. find people whose company you enjoy and click with. cling to those people ( not in a weird way ). foster those relationships. friendships are hard, you need to put effort into them if you want them to work. that means messaging on a daily basis, organising weekly meetups, listening to them when they are struggling ( and in turn them listening to you ). if you have any antisocial addictions, make them social! hard core gamers, get all over discord. alcoholics, attend aa meetings ( plural ). you get the drift. 3. don ’ t limit yourself in what you can and can ’ t do due to the judgments of others ( parents, friends, etc ). helplessness and lack of control is my depression complex on its own. go get your motorbike license, or get that bitch tattoo, because never dress on a night out. idc just go do it because we ’ ll hate yourself for not. 4. routine. get yourself a routine. i cannot stress this enough. getting out of bed is the hardest part of the day for some people. on my worst days, i ’ ll make sure more than anything to brush my teeth. from there on out everything just flows. shower - & gt ; breakfast - & gt ; car - & gt ; work / uni education... i won ’ t get into the psychology of it because it ’ s extremely broad and long winded, i could do a whole ten thousand word thesis on it.

feeling that way? depression is a very emotional state of being and a diary is a really productive way to rationalise all these intense thoughts and emotions running around in your head. putting them

stop even when ive brought to a conclusion rant : the other day i went to a family reunion which is usually something i look forward to as it is all fun and games during those times. one big part of my depression and stress is family and mainly my elder sister ( three sisters, eldest sister is very supportive of me, and i am the youngest child ) we got in a good little argument where she ended up raising her voice at me, and still i never cry over stuff like that but i think everyhing ive carefully stacked on top of eachother finally came crashing down all at once. i didnt want to cry in front of all my cousins ( who i love ) so i walked to another room where my eldest sister was trying to take a nap. i dont know what i would have done if this hadnt been seperated like that and i think i am very lucky. i ended up sobbing in the dark for an hour while mother talked about everyhting that has gone down and it was the most genuine conversation and i definitely needed it. and then my other sister had walked in only to yell at me more for being inconsiderate. we then all talked as siblings and i couldnt even speak for myself as i couldnt talk over my tears. she then said she wasnt grateful or something and said she wished she grew up with different friends, in a different house, and a different face. honestly i think she is the pretty sister and it rly hurt and annoyed me when she had said that because i always felt below her and everyone looked at her cuz someone was prettier. and saying she basically wasnt grateful for what we had which is one of the only things i live for, really pushed me over. we both appologized but it didnt feel genuine and thinking about it gets me teary eyed because the sense of over loading frustration just tipping over is utterly the worst. even when we had came to a conclusion i can swear she has changed. i am super grateful for my eldest sister who prolly has had it the hardest with our parents and being the oldest, and i also feel

occasionally i hear brief calls from whoever ’ s car i am in at the time. those things are scary because they look unfamiliar. often when i hear one of those noises, i ' d jump out of the car that i was in. i think i have been jumping out of other people ’ s cars so often i don ’ t even know where my own car is anymore. now when people ask me to get into their cars, my can barely hear them anymore. the noises of life have gotten too much. all i want is to get into someone ’ s car and have them take me wherever mine. but i don ’ hardly anymore know how to make my own voice heard anymore. now, whenever someone stops to let me in and ask me where i am going, the only way i know how to have my voice be heard is to shout over the noises of life. and when i shout at someone trying to help

redditors, i really need help so i ’ d appreciate if you would read my post and maybe change my life to help me see the light again. i have seen a lot of posts and advices on good books but i ’ d like actually read a few books more specific for a guy my age, books maybe change my perspective on life and to feel happy again. just a little background : i ’ m a 22 year old guy who has suffered a lot lately. i had a decent relationship with a girl who is perfect in everyones eyes : loving, loyal, beautiful, smart, studying & amp ; working hard to guarantee ourselves a bright future. the problem was that she was literally too good and respectful for me and i didn ’ t love her enough for some reasons. i ’ m still trying to figure those in. we decided to break up because i didn ’ t see her as the mother of my children. i cheated on her twice ( kissing a different girl ) and i know i would never do that when i was together with someone i love truly. not trying to justify the cheating, because i know that ’ s completely wrong and we both suffered from it. after the second time i knew i didn ’ t love her enough. anyways, we broke up half a year ago and since then everything has going downhill for me. i did good in school, had a good life and was happy until then. for her, i was in pain because i knew i would never have someone like het ever again, but once again, i just didn ’ t see any future with her even though she is perfect in any way possible. i just need someone who is less polite and who wouldn ’ t be afraid to have a discussion with me when i ’ m wrong. i know that seems really weird to hear, but it is what it is. i became an addict, used to do drugs once a year at a festival but in september i bought a lot at once, just to feel happiness again. even discovered cocaine and ketamine and became addicted. i am doing way less now than then but still too much. i used to take pills in bed just to feel happy during the night. sometimes 6 pieces a night. been to the doctor and a psychologist and they are now helping me to do less and eventually try again. my parents know nothing about me doing drugs and i want to keep it that way, my friends do know though and they are concerned. the relationship with my mother has been unstable for a few years. it is better now but we still fight a lot, also because she is really depressed and that is hard to deal with. the relationship with my dad is perfect though. they ’ re both single. relationship with my siblings ( kids of my mom, different dad ) is pretty good too. i used to text a different girl but when i fell in love she stopped responding and that ’ s why i have been feeling bad for the past few days. i have good days, but sometimes, like today, i feel useless. i hate thinking about having to work whole my life to then spend your money when you ’ re - in my opinion - too old. ( here you can reture when you are 67, probably 70 when it ’ s my time to retire. ) i just have a feeling that this life is not for me and i want to know the meaning of life. in my eyes we live to work and then die, if that ’ s what life is, i don ’ t want to live that life. but no, i would never commit suicide if that ’ s what you ’ re thinking. but i know there is way more than that, i just have a wrong perception of life and i want it to change. i ’ ve been watching a lot of motivational speakers lately and i ’ ve read a lot about books changing the life of many people. ( the subtle art of not giving a f * ck, meditations,... ). it really has an impact on me and i know there are reasons to live and ways to be happy. i really want to feel happy again, find reasons to live this life and just be positive in life, having the ability to control ( and maybe even turn off ) my emotions in stead of letting them take control over me. if you read until here, i am very thankful, you are a good person for willing to help someone in need. now, what books do you people recommend to find the meaning of life, to be positive again, to gain control over your emotions and just to be happy again. i am desperate for good books and i know they will help me become a positive person. any recommendation is fine, i just want to feel happy again, forever. thank you very much for reading & amp ; have a good day : )', 'could i just read old messages to further help me leaving the dark : man how i miss you people', 'i just stared so empty : it just needed to do something', 'i don ’ no feel like waking you until a morning anymore. : [ 5 ]', \"my life has been a consistent downward slope. : when i was young i remember feeling genuinely happy a lot. i ' ve slowly slid downhill because there, i managed to move uphill precisely once in my life. i tricked a girl into loving me for three years, until she finally wise up then told me to get lost. i lost my friend group from high school, and haven ' t tried to keep a friend very over a year since then. i ' ve come to the conclusion that i ' m just not a very likable person, and all knowledge, plus my loneliness helps me to become more human, and less likable which perpetuates the cycle. i just feel like i was never really meant to exist, like life has slots for gears, and i ' m just a disc, so i could never get any traction. i guess it makes sense?

’ t even realize that i missed a month of school. and these are people that i ’ ve know for two years, we all know each other in my program because there ’ s only 60 with us. things feel like if people don ’ t notice that i ’ m gone for a month, they never really cared about me at all. my friends told me that everyone was just busy with finals so no one was really paying attention to anything but themselves. but i still feel like no one cares about me and i dealing with everything on my own. after that i started to admit that i genuinely hate everyone. i hate seeing other people laughing and smiling with other people. i deserve to be happy too. i stopped talking to a lot of my friends because i realized that they only ever talked to me whenever they needed anything. i tried talking to one of my friends about my whole situation and she said i was just being dramatic. i stopped talking to her about myself after that. but now i ’ m starting to realize that i ’ m changing. i will spend the entire day without saying a word or talk to anyone. i hate seeing other people be happy. i want them to be in the same situation as me. i keep looking at people and hoping something bad happens to them. i never thought to before. i started drinking before i go to bed because i can ’ t sleep anymore. we used to love my program and going to school. but now when ever i hate even entering the building and see people in my program. i stopped caring about things. i don ’ t care about school, or my life or about me. i have no motivation at all do anything. i used to have my life together and now everything is a mess. i don ’ t like who i am right know. i really want to go back to who i was. but i don ’ t know what i ’ m supposed to do. sorry for the long rant', \"what will you people do

intense memories. these images in my head that i can \\' t get rid of. thing is, im pretty sure i was a difficult kid. i would get into fights with shane a lot of times. like once when i was really young i threw a rock at my sister and made rachel bleed. he yelled at me for a guy and kept pushing me against the wall and weighing me down. \" you could have killed her! \" he said that. i still remember it. now i hardly ever get in fights with him. i just fight with my mom now. another time when i was maybe 14 my brother was annoying me and as i poured syrup on my waffles i told him, \" did you know you have to stab somebody a lot of times for them to die? people think its only once but its actually a lot. \" something like that. my dad was in the room. the next thing i knew he whisked me away to the garage. i was there for over an hour. he yelled at us a bunch of times and threatened to have me comitted to an institution. we had a bunch of bikes in the garage that he kept pushing me against. i kept knocking them over. at one point he grabbed me around the neck and said, \" i \\' ll kill you, \" through gritted teeth. he was mad, i think because he thought i \\' d actually try to stab my brother. he kept threatening me, saying what hed do to me if i tried to do anything to \" his family. \" so as you can see i was a difficult kid. i did / said things that were fucked up sometimes. i feel like, in a way, i deserved what happened to me in the garage. though the fact that it still haunts me at age 20 makes me think it might have seen a not quite normal reaction on his part. i have other memories : once he sat on my head on the sidewalk once. or another time when he called me a goddamn pussy, or if he called me a pussy. or all those times shane used to lock me outside. mostly i just remember how his face looned when he \\' d get like that : his pipils tiny, his mouth bared into a growl. his veins kinda popping out, his hair askew. its a very familiar image to me. thing is this post makes him seem like some kind of monster though, and hes really not. sometimes he seems like a sad old man to me. other times he seems like a banal asshole, hardly worth my time. and i no he got hit a lot when he was a kid, way worse than i ever was. he always told me how lenient he was with me compared to how his father would have been. his grandfather was even worse. apparently once his grandfather didnt like how his father reached across the table during dinner, so he stabbed his hand with a fork. so in a way, im lucky. but other times i am so angry. i think about killing him. ever since i was a kid i have fantasized about killing him, or at least breaking his shins with a hammer. sometimes i get so angry that i wish i could kill everyone. or better yet,

could open up to about anything, who i though was my best friend. we shared the good times, the bad, the sick and the sad together. we were both introverts so we basically had each other then friends at work. we were not the big party type more of the party of 2 type so she was basically all i had, so you could say she was my best friend, as everyone who wants that bliss of a relationship. one night we were drinking together, enjoying a great time playing games together and just having a great time when we started a serious conversation about our future... this is where things go down hill and fast. we got to talking about what we would want and things we could see us doing in the morning. i go on saying how i ’ d like to own a 1968 dodge charger and to be happily married and she went on too day she wanted to own a 70 hp dart and to finally have a successful marriage. we get to drinking some more and she lets it slip... that she had cheated on me twice in the first 3 weeks of our relationship... once with her ex husband and once again with a random hook up she had planned in vegas for some sort of convention she had for her current place of work. i kept dead in my tracks of doing anything... feeling my chest tighten up.. i was tired of how she would hit me or do horrible abusive things to me. i had got up and just walked out of the house and went to a friends house. didn ’ t want to speak of kr or even see her... i mean for fucks sake if someone moves too fast in my general direction i flinch now i had no idea why would of happens if i had said something. i was raised to never lay a hand on a woman so i was defenseless... i call off the next day of work and just call her and tell her i want all of her stuff out of the home i own. we get into a big argument, her saying oh it was so far in the past i should just forget about it. it ’ s done and over now why ruin something we have now. “ what a relationship built on lies? ” i say to kr. i went through her fight for her kids, fight to keep her own stuff. through thick and thin for that woman for her to say she cheated on me in the start... after the big ending / fight we had she tells me i ’ m this and that

acknowledged positively. if at all, it ’ s just a scoff and a “ huh, i could do that, you ’ re not special ” or something like that. and all my flaws are pointed out right in my face and i ’ m

vocal, so i already have another friend who is pretty vocal, and i don ’ t really wanna steal her thunder there. not saying we don ’ t support her, though, i just don ’ t wanna double the burden or make her feel unimportant in her problems. i just don ’ t know anymore. basically everyone with me has goals, aspirations, hopes, dreams, and smiles all round and all i have is my best fake smile and a personal mantra of “ a positive attitude makes for a positive day too even though that ’ s really not working, honestly. just, gosh, i ’ m trying so hard to be something worthwhile, but i just don ’

hitting another episode of deep, spiraling depression right now, i find myself empowered by my own words. i hope some of you find this letter helpful as well. my mentality, for my entire life i feel like, has been plagued by me victimizing myself. i blow small situations out of proportion, i get in the way of what i want ( many examples throughout my relationship with who i believe is the best boyfriend i ’ ve ever had ), and i give my power of happiness toward other people. i expect a certain level of comfort to be provided to me, and when it was not delivered, i become miserable, blaming others for treating me this way, or the universe for the way i am, for making me as traumatized of an individual as i am. i need to stop. everything i ’ ve done, everything that has happened to me, is for me to take responsibility for. i need to stop being selfish and care about feeling good, or having someone else make me feel better. they ’ re not responsible for my happiness, my success, or my suffering. i am. i am not powerless. i decide what she want. and no one else need to get me who understand me for me to be happy. i do not need to please other people. i will do what i want to do, and say what i really want, instead of feeling powerless and continue to suffer. i also do not need make other people feel bad for the things i did to myself. i should ask for their intention, and respond by listening with intent. the perspective over my victim identity only adds to my suffering, and amplify the situation even more than what it is. i should not find fault with others, because that is why i end up dwelling on faults i find in myself. this victim mentality is not permanent, and it is not something i will carry with me for the rest of my life. this is something i can change, and the first step to it remains recognizing that i have been acting like a victim. i am not powerless in this change, and i will remove that victim identity with myself.', 'a trip to die for : next week im

observe. be aware. accept. let go. see, if two mental walls pushed you in the middle for a very long time, we would be so annoyed that we \\' d then try to push them back because so many people tell us to fight our depression ; so, we try to fight it, thus end up breaking our metaphorical arms, feeling desperate because we \\' ve tried everything, and when you fight too much and try to resist too much, you feel like you \\' ve been defeated. i say : * * stop fighting. * * all you have to do is be aware of that feeling that comes and goes. depression will be there most of the time, but sometimes it \\' s not. we can all agree that depression isn \\' t always equally horrible. sometimes, it gets annoying, it bothers us and we can \\' t focus on the work, and sometimes it gets unliveable and we try to end it all because it bothers us way too much. you have to be aware of those feelings, you need to know when they \\' re happening. you have to understand that when shit gets too tough, it \\' s not you being weak, but it \\' s your depression telling you to stop resisting pain. accept the pain, let it come and go, but you have to do this while being aware of this happening, you have to notice when it happens so that when you think of ending it all, just realize that it \\' s not you. sometimes we get too lost in depression, we think that depression defines our personality and that without us we would be losers, hence people think that depression is a good thing. this is a wrong mindset. without depression, you would feel exactly the same - except the ne ##gativity. everything will become manageable, you will be more focused, more energetic, more everything + less negativity. your \" asshole \" or \" smart depressed guy \" personality will be there as well, but only if you want it to be there. depression doesn \\' t last forever, and this is for real. it seems like it \\' s forever, but it \\' s not. you have to be aware when the shit times happen, but you also have to be aware when the good times happen, because even though they don \\' t feel like good times, you have to be aware of them so you could evaluate that they could be worse. some people struggle too hard to be happy, so when something good happens to them, they feel like they don \\' t deserve it because depression doesn \\' t let happy things make them happy. but they do make you happy to some degree, and be aware of it when it happens, because when you think of ending it all, you have to remember these times when good things happened to you despite the fact that you weren \\' t happy, because you have to realize that there are good things in the world and that depression is like glasses that don \\' t let you see them. these glasses, just like any other glasses, don \\' t last forever, they get blurry, they stop working, so naturally they get off your face. moral of the story : awareness is the key, for both the negative and positive situations. when walls push you and you \\' re stuck and can \\' t move, stop resisting, be aware. always remember that this doesn \\' t last forever, remember this post in your head whenever you think that you \\' re never gonna get rid of it. truth is, some people can \\' t get rid of it, but depression will leave by itself. learn to say no to people, learn to give yourself what you want because it helps you to learn self - love because you \\' re giving your mental health some space and freedom. no matter what people you disappoint or make angry, know that you don \\' t have to care about them at the moment. as long as depression is there, you can \\' t help anyone because what happens when you have a flu and try to cure another person who has a flu? wouldn \\' t that be extremely difficult? or when being on an airplane and things go wrong, did you know that the passangers have to put on masks on their faces first before they put on their child \\' s face?

work on her masters degree, while also having to take care of her nieces and nephews ( 5 in total ) from like 7 am to 6 pm every weekday until their parents come to pick them up and making sure the house is spotless before her parents come or else they yell at her. she ’ s struggling very hard to get and keep friends. the friends she wants to have ( the ones of about 5 - 6 years ) are ghosting her for no reason and want nothing to help with her even though she ’ s done nothing wrong to them. there are two people she talks to now that she knows from school, but it feels like she doesn ’ t want to try with them in fear of getting ghosted and pushed away again. she feels like everyone is constantly mad at her and it persuades the actions she takes. the other day she felt like her family would be mad at her for buying a hydro flask, particularly though it was with her money and her family even found it for her on facebook marketplace. with this i do feel like her patience is very thin. i do get on her nerves sometimes i will admit, but i personally feel like the way she reacts when i do something so small and unintentional, is too much. for example, two nights ago i was at her house. she has a brita water container that i used to fill my bottle with, so as a courtesy i wanted to fill up the container again. she was thankful and helped me hold the container while i put water in it with her retractable water faucet. i filled up the container and took the faucet out, but in the process i accidentally wet her pants a little bit. i thought she would just say something like “ you got me wet! can you hand me a towel? ”, but instead i got “ who the hell dude?? or would you wet me like that?? ” and i told her “ i ’ m sorry, it was an accident, i didn ’ t mean to ”, but she continued being aggressive about it, which got me frustrated because i kept apologizing. i got her a towel and dried her off and said sorry again. i personally don ’ t think i should have been met with this aggression. this went on for about an hour, with the argument getting worse to the point where i wanted to storm out of her house. my girlfriend is extremely insecure and i try my hardest to reassure her, but sometimes it ’ s difficult because she doesn ’ t believe the things i say. last night i took her to class, but before that i wanted to do something with her ( sexual wise ), so i went down on her and kept telling her that she is beautiful ( she has newly formed stretch marks and it ’ s really effecting her ). i made sure to let her know that i ’ m attracted to her, but then later that night she texted me and basically said she doesn ’ t want to talk to me and how could i do something so horrible. i was really confused. she explained to me that i had liked a picture with a girl showing her “ skinny stomach ” and she kept saying “ go date a skinny girl then ”. i was extremely confused because i don ’ t really like pictures like that, especially knowing my girlfriends insecurity. so i asked her if she could at least tell me what social media it was on so i can check my likes ( which i did and found nothing ). she basically told me “ why does it matter, you still did it ”. and then she told me goodnight. but me still confused i tried calling her multiple times, with her rejecting the call, and then i texted her saying “ well you saw the picture, can you screenshot it to me so i know what you ’ re talking about? ” she finally did after ignoring me, and it was a picture of a youtubers wife posting a picture of her being proud of her body since she had been working out a lot. and i finally understood her. what i don ’ t understand is that i liked that picture two years ago ( july 30th, 2018 ) when her and i were six months together. how she found that i liked it was super confusing to me. but she basically asked me not to like pictures line that anymore, and i explained to her that i already don ’ t. which she got frustrated about because she just wanted me to tell her that. i don ’ t know if it ’ s something i ’ m doing? but i personally feel like what i ’ m doing isn ’ t that bad to get such an aggressive response from. i admit i get angry and mean, but only if she jumps out of the gate being aggressive. i ’ ll match her tone and then she ’ ll get mad at me for having a tone. i explain to her “ by you telling me i have a tone is giving me a tone. ” because i know when i talk to her i try to talk very calmly. what the hell can i do. i want to be with her and she ’ s an amazing person, but once she gets angry she ’ s mean,

become operational, i have not even started class or gone through any additional training. my “ job ” is to exist and check in at certain times for accountability purposes, i don ’ t even do anything as basic as janitorial work. i ’ ve also been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and a handful months back i struggled with substance abuse. i ’ m in the middle of a desert, too young to drink, in a rundown building that ’ s illegally overcrowded. could give more details was all of this already requested, but the point is i ’ m aware that i ’ m not doing too hot. that being said, my main experience has been bettering myself and not inflicting my pain on anyone else. most of my friends have graduated and went on to another base or permanently discharged back home. i struggle with socializing and making new friends so when i make a friend i don ’ t quite be rude or dependent but did do treat them better and tolerate more than someone with more connections would. this all being said, i ’ m not doing myself any favors by being passive. last night i proceeded and pull the plug and piss all over it with a long term friend from back home. she ’ s my age and we ’ ve known eachother since 2nd grade. i ’ ve done as lot for her over the years, mostly just verbal / emotional support. like every single day on the bus until we could drive and then some. we stopped talking around that time but reconnected a couple months ago, and gradually i started expressing to her how i ’ ve always been depressed and suicidal i just keep it to myself but it ’ s getting worse ( esp with not having control over my life ). she ’ s told me it hurts for her to hear that and that she ’ s always there for me if i needed it. she and her friend invited me over new years and after expressing how suicidal i was she “ comforted me ” until i stopped crying and then made up a story of her friend ’ s sister being in the hospital and that they had to check on her, and i had to go home. i was shitfaced drunk and still shaking from the breakdown i ’ d just had and she lied to my face and sent me out into the cold to figure shit out. anyways, i noticed some discrepancies and called her out on it last night. she “ apologized ” but not really as there were more excuses for her behavior than genuine remorse. this isn ’ t the first time she ’ s fucked me over so i wasn ’ t backing down and then she had her friend from that night start texting me too, which i ignored. she gaslighted me two weeks ago when i was home and she gaslighted me last night. before that text last night i hung out with another girl on my base who is currently married. we actually met in a mental health institution and nearly got married but i cut it off. we gave eachother space, she ended up getting married to a different guy over christmas, and now here we are the best of buds. i ’ ve felt wronged by her in the past, ex. she only talks to me when she ’ s really low and needs someone to pull her up, but when i ’ m low or even neutral just bored and want to hang out she ’ s always too busy. generally i have kept it to myself, telling myself i ’ m just being pessimistic or jealous of her new bf / husband, but it ’ s been feeling too often to be made up in my head. last night she was low again so we went out for dinner. even after eventually admitting to her that i was making plans to end my life just the day before ( two days ago now ) we mostly talked about her. i didn ’ t get upset about it though i ’ m used to it. what did upset me was that she kept trying to get me and my waitress to flirt. she said she was cute and i agreed, i guess that ’ s all she needed to hear to make awkwardly direct statements to our waitress that me and her were not together, i was single, flag her down randomly just to bring her to the table for me to talk to her, constantly be searching / staring at and talking about her the whole time once she started. i continuously told her to stop, maybe not assertively enough but my facial expressions, tone of voice and mannerisms went from relaxed smiles to tensed up uncomfortable playing with my straw saying i just wanted to go home. she even waived down another waitress to ask if ours was single ( she wasn ’ t, btw ) because “ i was interested in her ”. i didn ’ t ask for any of this. i didn ’ t encourage any of this. if i wanted to talk to my waitress i ’ d talk to my waitress myself. i felt humiliated and emasculating afterwards. i was upset and had nothing to say and she was texting on her phone so we didn ’ t say anything on the way home. i was generally doing very well yesterday, lots of smiles and no stress. after dinner i was visibly upset with the exception of tears. we got back on base and she said she ’ d text me last night and i said alright see ya. not to any surprise she didn ’ t, but after texting girl # 1 my neighbor i texted her too. i expressed that i understood she had good intentions but her actions upset me and that she said she ’ d text me but didn ’ t. i said i wasn ’ t mad upset or disappointed, i ’ m just sensing in general that i ’ m putting more energy into our relationship than she is. i apologized if i caused her any more stress while she ’ s in class and wished her the best of luck. in the morning i got a structured reason 1, 2, 3, 4 reply of how she was innocent and how i ’ ve made her look bad. i told her that she ’ s making herself look bad by bringing up my decisions and her reputation in the military when i was discussing our friendship. then she said that broken people can ’ t fix broken people, she ’ d done everything she could for me, and that she can ’ t force me to “ open up and help myself ” because she ’ s better than that. also i should mention that in the past she ’ s used my substance abuse against me in arguments. i ’ m sorry this is so long. i tried to stay on point and cut out a lot of details for whoever sees this but i seem to have fewer and fewer people to talk to. i ’ m going to cross post this. the first girl i wrote about, my neighbor, told me that i wasn ’ t kind to her and i ’ m too dramatic to deal with. the second, my friend on base,

depression. worse then i ever experienced. i was working 50 + hours a week as a substance abuse counselor and interventionist. i would come home and not be able to do anything. not only was i not taking care of my apartment but i also stopped taking care of myself. after about 6 months of shame at how out of control my apartment had gotten i went to see a therapist. she did not think i had depression so much as burn out from my job. i saw her weekly and worked on just doing 1 thing each week to take care of myself and my apartment. then the burn out really caught up to me and effected my job performance. i was let down but given the 300 minutes paid leave i accrued on unemployment. i had never been more relieved in my life. i now had a place to take time to focus on my health and social being. my primary care doctor changed due to insurance and at my first physical she saw an anomaly in my records. i had not had weight issues and it had been brushed off as bad diet and exercise by my former doctor and the endocrinologist she referred me to. the new doctor noticed one thyroid test missing. thyroid antibody test. after the results came back i showed that my thyroid antibodies were 100 times higher than normal. this means i had hashimoto thyroiditis. an auto immune disorder where your body attacks your thyroid like it is a virus. causing lower metabalism ( weight issues ), sleep issues and chronic fatigue. this coupled with my burnout is why i became so depressed. i was put on meds to help with swallowing as that was the only thing that could be treated for now. i was able to put a lot of work into my apartment and after 5 months found a new job i love without being overworked. now my apartment was a slow going process since i let it get so out of control. i got to a point were i got rid of bags and bags of trash and clutter. just random things i held onto for no reason. i was cleaning up after myself as i went ( doing dishes, taking out trash, sweeping ) trying to make sure it didn ' t get worse. then a month ago the building got roaches. i signed up with my neighbors for fumigation. the building manager sent me a letter that the extermina ##tor had made horrible accusations about my apartment. that i had cat waste on my floor and i lived like a hoarder. i was angry and devastated. one thing i always did was take care of my cat. so this was just not true. and after getting rid of so much stuff to have this said was devastating. they said they would come back in a week. i found even more things to get rid of. clothes, small appliances even one of my tvs. i bought a new litter box and litter tracking mat for my cat. i vacuumed every spec of cat litter. only to be told no change and we need to discuss next steps. now i was angry. when i asked what the issue was, stating i did what they asked. i was told clutter isn ' t the problem your apartment is too dirty. this is a bait switch i feel. but whatever. i made the appointment and was told they would do a new inspection at that time if i wanted. so i looked around and was lucky enough to find a wonderful woman who agreed to deep clean my apartment for only 65 $. she is here now and already the difference is huge. the layers of grime of the floor and in my bathroom are gone. i promised myself i will never get to this place again. i acknowledge i let things get out of control but wish my building manager had been more straight forward and clear as to what they took issue with. i will update after my meeting but thanks to this wonderful woman i don ' t see an

do, i want to tell you about why you should be grateful for what you have, and i \\' m talking about whatever you have. i used to be an orphan, my father had a heart attack in 2004 and my mom died from cancer in 2005. i lost both parents in the summer i turned 6. this has been the worst experience of my life and one i have accepted i cannot forget but deal with. there was very little caring. every time i tried to leave my family members with the attenders, i failed terribly. later when i was at 7 years i realized family can never be replaced. becoming an orphan broke me, and shattered everything i believed in. the worst part is that no child around you understands what you go through and feel everyday. after my mom passed in 2005, i returned to boarding school and became a completely different person, despite trying. i was alone, and scared. i wept everyday. i lost interest in everything that mattered to me and couldn \\' t keep things together. i became extremely quiet and shut myself out. i started struggling academically, i couldn \\' t study without crying or remembering my parents. i couldn \\' t focus. i was suffering emotionally. i had no one, absolutely no one to talk to. no one in my family ever reached out to me or said \" everything was going to be okay \". i hated visiting day, because parents came over and had fun with their kids and all i wanted was to have at least one parent visit. i somehow still believed they could come back and i prayed to god everyday for hours. i became extremely religious in that time. i felt vulnerable, there became no one to fight for me, no one to love me unconditionally and i was no longer protected. i found my trust in people and realized how selfish people were. we always get old and torn stuff to wear and play. no one ever donates fresh clothes or toys to orphaned children. till 11 years old i have never worn a dress of my size, always oversized, and i used to long for a rich kids birthday celebration so each could get to eat cake lmao whenever the attenders look at you, you have to be either studying or praying or else you would get beaten up. i remember being abused physically for being slow in certain things. wooden spoons to the mouth if you don \\' t finish your food or spill your food, tight slaps across the face, buttock spankings with hangar and others. there was never a day without screaming. fast forward to when i \\' m doing my spm... i knew that nobody would adobt me at this age, and when i hit 18 i would age out and have to fend on my own. so i did my best for spm, though i didn \\' t score straight a \\' s, my results were decent enough for me to get in sunway. fast forward to when i \\' m 18, aged out. just like that i \\' m out... i have to fend for myself. slept on the streets on the first few days, depressed and homeless. but i didn \\' t give up. i was lucky enough that my parents left some money and so i used that solely for my education in college and had to figure everything else out. like clothes, etc. i worked by teaching kids over the holidays to provide some of these cravings. i became very independent quickly and i had no one telling me what to do. in fact, i wish i had someone who cared enough to tell me what to do. i became very emotional, quick - tempered and defensive. i put up a wall and didn \\' t want to get hurt by anyone or anything, and avoided everything. i couldn \\' t handle my emotions and i attributed every hurtful situation to not having my parents around. i contemplated suicide every day. overtime, i have felt insecure, and it \\' s very hard for me to trust, but once i trust someone or something, there \\' s no turning back. i have a very big heart and would do anything to help anyone. my struggles and experiences has enabled me to appreciate everything around me and wish the best for everyone. before i became positive, i despised the word, i was angry, and hated everyone who had a parent or was supported through life. i guess i was jealous and didn \\' t understand why life had thrown this at me. i decided during my high school days, to turn everything around and fight for myself and my future. i knew i wouldn \\' t have anyone supporting me, and so i was ready to battle it. i set goals for myself and till today, i take it one step at a time. life is still not easy, i \\' m facing racial discrimination in work place and in class calling me names like k - word, robber, rapist jokingly under the mask of humour to hurt me but i \\' m not letting that affect me. if you are not my friend, i couldn \\' t give a damn about what you think or say about me. my experiences has made me tough. i appreciate love, even though it \\' s difficult to love, because i \\' m afraid of losing them. being an orphan sucks, it \\' s a tough, depressing, lonely, annoying and despiteful life and takes a lot of courage to make the decision to be a better person. however, all these experiences toughen will up anyone and there is nothing you cannot overcome because you have seen it all, have a really good heart, genuinely care about others, and want to make the world a better place. last week was my

half ago when i told his friend not to park his car in front of my house gate and blocking my car inside. after more than twenty week, one night he was drunken and seek revenge by asking his friend parked his car at the same spot again after i went out. when i came home and request his friend politely to move his car because he then threaten and provoked me for a fight. i knew he took alcohol because of his asian flush face. i was thinking to call the police at that time but i don ' t want to create too little attention since my family has slept. the next morning, i went to his home and requested an explanation and told him i was about to call the police if necessary. then i found that he was actually having mouth fight with his wife since yesterday and then i saw 3 of his kids, 3 of them age between 3 to 5. i was sympathy to his kids because i was unsure what wanna happen to his kids if he got jailed or something so i changed my mind. her wife was scared and kept apologized to me. but this guy never give up to provoke and threaten me. all these years, from time to time, when ever he heard my family and i are having dinner and chatting in the kitchen area, he will ask his kids to scream purposely to catch our attention or create deep thump sound with either pushing table to the wall or by his fist whenever he has chance. many times he did that during midnight after 2 am and causing me to move my bed room to another room. he never make the deep thump sound once and stop for like an hour more and continue again. i was thinking to confront him for this before thinking that he might said that his bullets hit something accidentally. sometimes when he has fight with his wife, he also slam the door at her kitchen and the sound freaks my family out because the door was made of metal. my mum and sis afraid of him because his body size is larger than me, they afraid he might hurt me or something. both of them ask me to ignore him. but he keeps harassing us and even teach his kids doing the same ( hit the wall with something hard ). whenever i heard his sound and knew he is in his house, my heart will start racing. i am not afraid of him because i know what he ' s doing is wrong. but my family won ' t allow me to confront with him. that really make me sick and feel like to move out as soon as i get a new job, but what about my family. they refuse to

isn ' t my first language. but nontheless i ' m try my best. i have been finding myself in a situation for the last 3 years. and i am not able to get myself out of it. i have a severe depression and suicidal thoughts. they already got clear with myself that i wil ' t commit suicide. i ' ve always been very curious and inquisitive and i don ' t what to miss anything in the future. that ' s saying i could never do it. but that wouldn ' t stops me from thinking about it. i think i know the 2 main reasons for my depression. my family and my social life better to say lack there of. my family actually seems like the nice family from next door. we never had any money problems or anything like that. but on the inside my family is falling apart. my biggest brother confessed last year to my mother that he is depressed and he couldn ' t go to work that day because he can ' t be sure he wouldn ' t drive his car in a wall. he went to a op psychiatric clinic. at first it seemed like my mother and him would start to get back together and were starting to build up a strong bond between them. but then it all went south. they only were fighting when she would visit him. it got to that point that my brother broke with my family and as he got out of the clinic he moved out. my mother is a mess since she learned about his depression. i think it ' s because that she thinks she messed up as a mother. but she doesn ' t only think that because of my biggest brother my second brother. is also drifting away from us. he gets aggressiv real fast and is almost never at home. only to sleep.. sometimes not even that. my little sister shows signs of a depression too during a while now. she doesn ' t have any good friends in school and the story of my brother seems to do also a great part on her. no we finally get to me. i also don ' t have any good friends. there is nobody i could talk to. but first i want to finish the part about my family. i am kind of a geek. so as soon i noticed some weird behavior of my dad. i installed a software on his laptop. 2 days later i got the result i was waiting for. he used multiple dating sites to flirt with other women i couldn ' t find out if he already met with someone but i believe that he did. anyway i got him to stop it. at least he doesn ' t use sites like these on his laptop anymore. i didn ' t talk to him. i don ' t want to say how i did it but i believe it worked. he doesn ' t know that i know about his secret. but i am still in a dilemma. do i tell my mom about it and definitely destroy our family and let my sister grow up with divorced parents or do i keep it for myself and i can ' t look my father in the eyes. i have kept everything secret for 2 years now. but still haven ' t decided what to do. my current plan is to break with my family in few years. as soon as i am financially stable enough to life on my own. i don ' t want to risk needing to come back to my family because of financial problems or anything like that. my second problem is my social life. as i already said i have no real friends. that is not really true i do have a friend. my best friend. but we after school he moved to another city. we rarely see each other. and each year it gets less. i can ' t talk to him about my problems because he got some weight to carry aswell and i don ' t want him to be concerned about me. i am singel for 3 years now. i only had one girlfriend. and she was abusive towards me. since that i almost never talked to a girl of my age group outside of work. and i feel that i am drifting closer towards the abyss each day. i wake up go to work get home go into my room and go to sleep. there is rarely something that disturbs that circle. my biggest fear is if i break with my family and move to another city that i won ' t meet new friends. and in the end i die alone. with no fun in life. i don ' t know what to do and how to get out of this situation. i just felt like sharing my story / current life situation with you guys. and i am really sorry for the long post.\", \"i hate my fucking brain : i discovered this subreddit today, and i have been reading a few posts. and i have readed some that describe situations where depression isn ' t validated at all, or feel themselves that they don ' t deserve to feel better, which obviously doesn ' t help. i feel that way too, but the more fucking disgusting thing is that i already have been a year in home, doing nothing but going to several therapists, and even then, i didn ' t progress even a bit, because or he / she doesn ' t ask me to give my opinion or express myself, or he / her doesn ' t speak a word and i have to progress myself from almost nothing, if this have been to a psychoanalyst you ' ll know that im talking about. and it ' s already difficult to talk about it, even more when you feel that you are complaining for nothing, and you are afraid to say that you are not following what he / she said you to do at all when it ' s hard. and that ' s exactly what encloses you in a loop, thinking you don ' t deserve to be comprehended, not communicating with your therapist and lying about your progress, not progressing because of that, and feeling more guilty. i don ' t know if i have expressed myself correctly and can be understood, but that ' s what i can say at the moment. i ' m conscient of the depression symptoms, but even so it ' s a constant fight against your thoughts and the way your reasoning works, until every hour i pass between thinking that it ' s reasonable to feel bad, and feeling guilty for it. i don ' r know who ' s fault is i ' m afraid to tell my mom how i really am, well, actually now i say it, it ' s probably beacuse the first therapist i ' ve been in my thoughts

high school and i have struggled a lot with school. my grades have dropped, although, for anyone else it ' p not that bad. i got my first bell ever last quarter... the rest have been a ' s and b ' s. but i feel like such a failure because of it. everyone around me that ii ' ve grown up with has instilled to me that i have to great things and be the best and go to college and make lots of money and be smart... but recently i felt so burnt out. i ' m in clubs, and extra - curricular, and sports, and most of the week i ' m staying 2 - 3 hours after school for them on top of extra help with classes. i just feel like i can ' t do it anymore but it ' s too late to change anything or look for alternatives to normal high school. recently, i was invited to the national honors society, but there ' m afraid i ' m not going to get in because my grades have been dropping. my parents say that it ' ll be fine if i don ' t get in, but they ' re constantly comparing me to my sister, and i know they ' ll be disappointed. and i know deep down that i have it better than most. that i shouldn ' t be worried because although my parents will be disappointed they only want the best for me. but we feel like i have to keep up their high expectation of me at the risk of making them worry or creating more work for myself. college has also been a large discussion with a family. honestly, i don ' t want to go to college anytime soon. i think the only motivation i have for going to college is that it ' s a chance of getting away from my family for a bit and being able to finally be myself. but i have no plans for my future. everything else in my life has been planned for me or done by my sister that i have never had to think about my future or what i want. in all honesty, i never thought i would be alive long enough to make it to college that i haven ' t even fathomed the idea of me even going. but now i have to decide what kind of school i want, where i want to be, what should i major in? and i have no answers to any of those questions, and college seems to be everywhere. it seems that wherever i go or whoever i talk to, college always seems to be brought up and i can ' t escape it. i brought up the idea of a gap year, or maybe going to a community college to get my gen eds out of the way while i figure things out but my parents have completely shut down the idea. friends have also made school hard in general. i used to not really have any friends, just people i went to school with and would talk to because i saw them 7 hours a day. recently a couple of my friends just don ' t seem to care about me. they don ' t care about my struggles because, to them, my life is good and i shouldn ' t be complaining about these types of things. which i guess is true, i have two parents who love each other and have stable jobs, but it doesn ' t make my struggles any less real. they expect me to not have any problems, but it seems they only come to me because of theirs. it makes me not want to talk to them which sucks because i don ' t want to leave them in the dust even after everything. however, recently i have formed a new friend group, and it ' s very good and everyone cares about each other. but my anxieties have gotten in the way because i ' ve never known what it ' s like to have friends that honestly care about you, that have similar interests, and i can be fully myself around. i don ' t know how to act with them, and i feel myself pulling away because i don ' t want things to get complicated when i open up to them one day. but they ' re one of the few good things in my life right now, and they ' re honestly the only reason why i ' m still trying right now. i didn ' t even realize how much these things have been bothering me up to now when i

main reason i am such is because i wasn ’ t shown hardly any physically affection when i was young. i can barely recall my parents having ever hugged me as a child. and even when they did it was usually awkward. and knowing who they really are now makes me wonder if any of it was even genuine. either way, being “ clingy ” is not something society is fond of. it ’ s regarded as annoying, stupid, childish, unnecessary, etc. and i ’ ve had people say it to them. like my dad saying, “ you shouldn ’ t cling to your sister in law like that. it gets even her nerves. ” and she is the type to literally shake my hand off if i try to hold her side, so i eventually stopped trying. a couple friends of mine don ’ t even physically contact much, so they are the type to actually push you off if you touch them. like my one friend literally shouted “ nope! ” and snatched her hand away when i tried once. and the other friend had to give me a sincere talk about it after asking her mom how to approach me on the matter. i get it, not everyone likes that. and i respect the people who don ’ t, even when they express it in a rude or blunt manner. but boy does it really add to my self hate. even my one friend who doesn ’ not mind it will jokingly say things like, “ i know, you ’ re clingy. ” and she ’ s right i am. she may mean no harm by saying it, but she doesn ’ t mean it doesn ’ t do harm regardless. and now people aren ’ t allowed to touch each other due to the coronavirus going around. but at this point, who cares? i never got physical affection before anyway? why would i worry about it now? at least, that ’ s what i tell myself. and others. i laugh it off. i respect others wishes and space. i brush it off and pretend like it doesn ’ t hurt. but it really, really, really, does. especially where i haven ’ t been shown any affection by the people who were supposed to care the most. i remember reading an article on a mans life story. he had a horrid childhood and almost died as a result of his parents neglecting him. he mentioned how he remembered being a little boy in his crib, and he ’ d bawl his eyes out when visitors came by. just because he wanted to be held. but everyone ignored him. i ’ d never cried after reading something like that before, but i did. i ’ m crying just writing about it now. and i did because it struck a cord with me. i can ’ t remember anything really specific but i do know there were times all i wanted was to be held / reassured by my parents, like any child should be, but i wasn ’ t. i was pushed away, yelled at, mocked, and called “ clingy. ” and they were right. i was. i am. and i ’ m sorry. i ’ m really truly sorry. i ’ m sorry wasn ’ t shown enough love as child. i ’ m sorry i don ’ t have many real friends who understand my feelings. i ’ m sorry i was wasn ’ t even kept by the parents that actually created me and will probably never know them. i ’ m sorry i ended up adopted by a family who didn ’ t really care. and i ’ m sorry all those things made me who i am. i don ’ t want to be clingy. i never wanted to be. i ’ m sorry i am. i wish i wasn ’ t. i wish i wasn ’ t me. i wish i was dead, and then i

'stress and feeling like a failure. : sorry for the wall of text, i tried to keep it as brief as possible i \\' m a 22 ( almost 23 ) year old trans women engaged with my girlfriend of three years, and together we have a one year old son. i love them many more than anything. however with an active life of work, fiance, and taking care of a child, i feel incredible amounts of stress. it certainly seems like on my days off there \\' s just one more thing to take care of, or an errand that requires my time. i usually don \\' t have that much free energy as i \\' m constantly busy with keeping my family afloat. don \\' hey get me wrong, i love my family, they mean the world to me, but holding it all together is taking its toll on me. on top of that i have depressive and gender dysphoric episodes. i feel that my depression stems from \" not being poor at anything. \" i want to be good at... something. at this point, i \\' ll take anything. my two major hobbies are competitive super smash bros melee, and i get sad about constantly losing, but i also don \\' t internalize that sadness as much because they don \\' t take it super seriously and its more for fun than anything ( though watching your rank on the constant decline on the community leader board can really be a bummer at times ). my other major hobby that i am more concerned about is drawing. i \\' ll been taking art classes since i was in 8th grade and i was even in ap art. i constantly have a feeling that i \\' m never improving. 2010 - 2015 i used to draw for school, and some for fun fan art stuff on the side when i was a nerdy teenager, but 2015 through now, i \\' ve hardly done anything. i \\' ve made maybe like 3 or 4 completed pieces of digital art and even then i \\' m not that confident about them. when ever i try to draw today, i just get like, almost physically i \\' ll. i feel like mine stomach drops and my heart rate goes up. at work, i have a lot of free time and i try to practice on yellow stickie notes at work but most of the time i usually crumple them up and toss them because i end up not being satisfied. i know that \\' s kinda considered a no no in the art community, but i \\' ve been doing this ever since i got a three out of five on my final ap art portfolio. i tore up a myriad of my ap art portfolio because a lot of it involved self portrait and those drawings of myself were before i even transitioned to female. i want so bad to find time to practice my art, but not even that, just being able to know and internalize that it doesn \\' t have to be perfect, and mistakes are part of learning. but everytime i get to work i just get really really fucking sad and i feel like i \\' m not ever going to improve because i \\' ve been at this for 10 years now. what \\' s particularly upsetting to me is that i have adhd, so focus is already a big issue. i want to hone in my attention on my art, but get so discouraged when i see people have actually completed a number of sketchbooks, meanwhile i struggle to even get one started and even when i do get started on one, i fill in like two or three pages and then don \\' t pick one up again for months. digital art is also a big frustration as the number of tutorials, art styles, tricks, etc. are just endless on the internet and with someone like me, it \\' s hard to sit down and actually learn. i can \\' t make it through 5 minutes through an art tutorial of any sort because i just.. i dunno... get antsy and go watch a melee clip or a video essay. i don \\' t know how i can easily sit through an hour long video essay about marxism or whatever, but the moment it comes to the things i really care about, i just can \\' t force myself to pay attention and absorb the learning material. i have a long shot dream of making a sci - fi cartoon one day. i don \\' t know how to even come close to it considering i can \\' t pay for college, let alone negotiate ( argue ) medical bill \\' s with my insurance company in relation to my transition, being barely able to afford the means to keep my family stable, not having enough time to practice, and even if i find time to practice, i just don \\' t out of anxiety or contempt of self. it depresses me that i can rationally argue that my dream won \\' t come true and that i \\' m just going to work a bullshit job for the rest of my life because i just can \\' t get it together. i have days of crying spells where i sit in the shower and have crying fits over gender dysphoria, depression, and just feeling like a massive failure. tl ; dr : i

him and driving him back in forth to the hospital for his chemotherapy and radiation treatments. last night he asked me if i would have married him again knowing he \\' d end up getting cancer. \" of course, \" i told him, \" i love you and i can \\' t imagine my life without you. \" i didn \\' t even have to think about it because the answer seemed obvious to me. i asked him if he would have married me again knowing how debilitating my depression can be. he was silent for a long time. then he said, \" i think so. \" that was not the answer i was expecting and it absolutely devastated me. i knew it was an honest answer, too, because my husband never lies to me. it hurt to hear the person who loves me and knows me the best admit that being married to me might not be worth the effort. he unknowingly confirmed one of my greatest fears : that no matter how hard i try, i \\' ll never be \" good enough \" to be in a relationship. i \\' ve done everything i can to cope with my depression. i \\' ve spoken to numerous therapists and tried at least half a dozen dozen antidepressants and antipsychotics. i force myself to venture out into the world and socialize with others even when i don \\' t feel like it. i eat healthy meals and exercise on a regular basis. still, my life is riddled with unbearable sadness and frequent thoughts of suicide. i struggle to conceal my depression from my loved ones as much as possible, so that i \\' m not a burden to them ( and so they won \\' t leave me ), but some days the emotional pain is so overwhelming and it seems to burst out of me. today is one of those days. being married to someone with cancer puts me in a tough position. everyone expects me to be \" strong \" for my husband, which essentially translates to me ignoring my own needs so i can be there for him 24 / 7. i \\' m dealing with a lot right now, but complaining about my own problems would seem artificial and trivial in comparison to what my husband is going through. caretaking is a thankless act. i have to suffer silently while my husband \\' s loved will cheer him on and praise him over being such a strong fighter. they don \\' t know what happens behind closed doors. they don \\' t see me deflecting my husband \\' s hurtful insults when the steroids make him irritable. they don \\' t see me cooking his meals, washing his clothes, or scrubbing his shit off the bathroom floors and walls when the chemotherapy makes him lose control of his bowels. it \\' s not easy, but i \\' m willing to do all of these things because i genuinely love my husband. that \\' s why it hurt me so much when he insinuated that i might not be worth marrying again. i \\' m in a lot of pain right now and i need to talk to someone about it. unfortunately my therapist doesn \\' t have an opening available for the next two weeks. my husband would be the next obvious choice, but i don \\' t want to tell him how i \\' m feeling because he already has enough to deal with. i can
